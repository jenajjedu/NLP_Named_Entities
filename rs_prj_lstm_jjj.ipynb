We are all praying for Prince Joffrey's full recovery.\", 629: \"A shame you didn't say a prayer for the butcher's son. Renly! You're looking well.\", 630: 'And you look tired from the road. I told them this meeting could wait another day, but...', 631: \"But we have a Kingdom to look after. I've hoped to meet you for some time, Lord Stark. No doubt Lady Catelyn has mentioned me.\", 632: 'She has, Lord Baelish. I understand you knew my brother Brandon as well.', 633: 'All too well. I still carry a token of his esteem from navel to collarbone.', 634: 'Perhaps you chose the wrong man to duel with.', 635: \"It wasn't the man that I chose, my Lord. It was Catelyn Tully. A woman worth fighting for, I'm sure you'll agree.\", 636: 'I humbly beg your pardon, my Lord Stark.', 637: 'Grand Maester.', 638: 'How many years has it been? You were a young man.', 639: 'And you served another King.', 640: 'How forgetful of me. This belongs to you, now. Should we begin?', 641: 'Without the King?', 642: \"Winter may be coming, but I'm afraid the same cannot be said for my brother.\", 643: 'His Grace has many cares. He entrusts some small matters to us that we might lighten the load.', 644: 'We are the lords of small matters here.', 645: \"My brother instructs us to stage a tournament in honor of Lord Stark's appointment as Hand of the King.\", 646: 'Mmm, how much?', 647: '40,000 gold dragons to the champion, 20,000 to the runner-up, 20,000 to the winning archer.', 648: 'Can the treasury bear such expense?', 649: \"I'll have to borrow it. The Lannisters will accommodate, I expect. We already owe Lord Tywin 3 million gold. What's another 80,000?\", 650: 'Are you telling me the Crown is three million in debt?', 651: \"I'm telling you the Crown is six million in debt.\", 652: 'How could you let this happen?', 653: 'The Master of Coin finds the money. The King and the Hand spend it.', 654: 'I will not believe Jon Arryn allowed Robert to bankrupt the realm.', 655: \"Lord Arryn gave wise and prudent advice, but I fear His Grace doesn't always listen.\", 656: 'Counting coppers,\" he calls it.', 657: \"I'll speak to him tomorrow. This tournament is an extravagance we cannot afford.\", 658: \"As you will. But still, we'd best make our plans.\", 659: 'There will be no plans until I speak to Robert. Forgive me, my Lords. I had a long ride.', 660: \"You are the King's Hand, Lord Stark, we serve at your pleasure.\", 661: \"Please, it's nearly healed.\", 662: \"It's ugly.\", 663: \"A King should have scars, you fought off a direwolf. You're a warrior like your father.\", 664: \"I'm not like him. I didn't fight off anything. It bit me and all I did was scream. And the two Stark girls saw it, both of them.\", 665: \"That's not true. You killed the beast. You only spared the girl because of the love your father bears her father. When Aerys Targaryen sat on the Iron Throne, your father was a rebel and a traitor. Someday you'll sit on the throne and the truth will be what you make it.\", 666: 'Do I have to marry her?', 667: \"Yes. She's very beautiful and young. If you don't like her, you only need to see her on formal occasions and when the time comes, to make little princes and princesses. And if you'd rather fuck painted whores, you'll fuck painted whores. And if you'd rather lie with noble virgins, so be it. You are my darling boy and the world will be exactly as you want it to be. Do something nice for the Stark girl.\", 668: \"I don't want to.\", 669: 'No, but you will. The occasional kindness will spare you all sorts of trouble down the road.', 670: 'We allow the northerners too much power. They consider themselves our equals.', 671: 'How would you handle them?', 672: \"I'd double their taxes and command them to supply 10,000 men to the royal army.\", 673: 'A royal army?', 674: \"Why should every lord command his own men? It's primitive, no better than the hill tribes. We should have a standing army of men loyal to the Crown, trained by experienced soldiers... Instead of a mob of peasants who've never held pikes in their lives.\", 675: 'And if the northerners rebel?', 676: \"I'd crush them. Seize Winterfell and install someone loyal to the realm as Warden of the North. Uncle Kevan, maybe.\", 677: 'And these 10,000 northern troops, would they fight for you or their lord?', 678: \"For me. I'm their King.\", 679: \"But you've just invaded their homeland, asked them to kill their brothers.\", 680: \"I'm not asking.\", 681: \"The North cannot be held... not by an outsider. It's too big and too wild. When the winter comes, the Seven gods together couldn't save you and your royal army. A good King knows when to save his strength... And when to destroy his enemies.\", 682: 'So you agree... The Starks are enemies?', 683: \"Everyone who isn't us is an enemy.\", 684: 'Enough of that, young lady. Eat your food.', 685: \"I'm practicing.\", 686: 'Practicing for what?', 687: 'The Prince.', 688: 'Arya, stop!', 689: \"He's a liar and a coward and he killed my friend.\", 690: 'The Hound killed your friend.', 691: 'The Hound does whatever the Prince tells him to do.', 692: \"You're an idiot.\", 693: \"You're a liar.

May I be excused?\", 700: \"You've barely eaten a thing.\", 701: \"It's all right. Go on.\", 702: 'War was easier than daughters.', 703: 'Go away!', 704: 'Arya, open the door. May I come in? Whose sword is that?', 705: 'Mine.', 706: \"Give it to me. I know this maker's mark. This is Mikken's work. Where did you get this? This is no toy. Little ladies shouldn't play with swords.\", 707: \"I wasn't playing. And I don't want to be a lady.\", 708: 'Come here. Now what do you want with this?', 709: \"It's called Needle.\", 710: 'A blade with a name. And who were you hoping to skewer with Needle? Your sister? Do you know the first thing about sword fighting?', 711: \"Stick 'em with the pointy end.\", 712: \"laughs] That's the essence of it.\", 713: 'I was trying to learn. I asked Mycah to practice with me. I asked him. It was my fault.', 714: \"No, sweet girl. You didn't kill the butcher's boy.\", 715: 'I hate them! I hate all of them. The Hound, the Queen and the King and Joffrey and Sansa.', 716: 'Sansa was dragged before the King and Queen... And asked to call the Prince a liar.', 717: 'So was I! He is a liar.', 718: \"Darling, listen to me. Sansa will be married to Joffrey someday. She cannot betray him. She must take his side even when he's wrong.\", 719: 'But how you can let her marry someone like that?', 720: \"Well… Look at me. You're a Stark of Winterfell. You know our words.\", 721: 'Winter is coming.', 722: \"You were born in the long summer. You've never known anything else. But now winter is truly coming. And in the winter, we must protect ourselves, look after one another. Sansa is your sister.\", 723: \"I don't hate her. Not really.\", 724: \"I don't want to frighten you, but I won't lie to you either. We've come to a dangerous place. We cannot fight a war amongst ourselves. All right? Go on. It's yours.\", 725: 'I can keep it?', 726: \"Try not to stab your sister with it. If you're going to own a sword, you'd better know how to use it.\", 727: \"Don't listen to it. Crows are all liars. I know a story about a crow.\", 728: 'I hate your stories.', 729: 'I know a story about a boy who hated stories. I could tell you about Ser Duncan the Tall. Those were always your favorites.', 730: \"Those weren't my favorites. My favorites were the scary ones.\", 731: 'Oh, my sweet summer child. What do you know about fear? Fear is for the winter, when the snows fall a hundred feet deep. Fear is for the long night, when the sun hides for years and children are born and live and die all in darkness. That is the time for fear, my little Lord, when the White Walkers move through the woods. Thousands of years ago there came a night that lasted a generation. Kings froze to death in their castles, same as the shepherds in their huts. And women smothered their babies rather than see them starve, and wept and felt the tears freeze on their cheeks. So is this the sort of story that you like? In that darkness, the White Walkers came for the first time. They swept through cities and kingdoms, riding their dead horses, hunting with their packs of pale spiders big as hounds…', 732: 'What are you telling him now?', 733: 'Only what the little Lord wants to hear.', 734: 'Get your supper. I want some time with him. One time she told me the sky is blue because we live inside the eye of a blue-eyed giant named Macumber.', 735: 'Maybe we do.', 736: \"How do you feel? You still don't remember anything? I've seen you climb a thousand times. In the wind, in the rain... A thousand times. You never fall.\", 737: \"I did though. It's true, isn't it... what Maester Luwin says about my legs? I'd rather be dead.\", 738: \"Don't ever say that.\", 739: \"I'd rather be dead.\", 740: 'Fewer eyes back here, my Lady.

You take me for some back-alley Sally you can drag into a…', 750: 'I meant no disrespect to you of all people.', 751: 'How dare you bring me here!

I'm truly sorry... about the locale.\", 753: \"How did you know I was coming to King's Landing?\", 754: 'A dear friend told me.', 755: 'Lady Stark.', 756: 'Lord Varys.', 757: 'To see you again after so many years is a blessing. Your poor hands.', 758: 'How did you know I was coming?', 759: 'Knowledge is my trade, my Lady. Did you bring the dagger with you, by any chance? My little birds are everywhere. Even in the north. They whisper to me the strangest stories. Valyrian steel.', 760: 'Do you know whose dagger this is?', 761: 'I must admit I do not.', 762: \"Well well, this is an historic day. Something you don't know that I do. There's only one dagger like this in all of the Seven Kingdoms. It's mine.\", 763: 'Yours?', 764: \"At least it was, until the tournament on Prince Joffrey's last nameday. I bet on Ser Jaime in the jousting, as any sane man would. When the Knight of the Flowers unseated him, I lost this dagger.\", 765: 'To whom?', 766: 'Tyrion Lannister. The Imp.', 767: \"If that were a real sword, you'd be dead. Lord Snow here grew up in a castle spitting down on the likes of you. Pyp.

There's only so much I can stomach in a day.\", 770: 'A charming man.', 771: \"I don't need him to be charming. I need him to turn this bunch of thieves and runaways into men of the Night's Watch.\", 772: \"And how's that going, Commander Mormont?\", 773: \"Slowly.

Perhaps I'll write my sister, the Queen, about it.\", 792: \"We'll talk later, Lord Snow.\", 793: 'Everybody knew what this place was and no one told me. No one but you. My father knew and left me to rot here at the Wall all the same.', 794: \"Grenn's father left him too... Outside a farmhouse when he was three. Pyp was caught stealing a wheel of cheese.

Lucky for you. Mine was some Tarly boy at the Battle of Summerhall. My horse took an arrow so I was on foot, slogging through the mud. He came running at me, this dumb high-born lad, thinking he could end the rebellion with the single swing of his sword. I knocked him down with the hammer. Gods, I was strong then. Caved in his breastplate. Probably shattered every rib he had. Stood over him, hammer in the air. Right before I brought it down he shouted, \"Wait! Wait!\"... They never tell you how they all shit themselves. They don\\'t put that part in the songs. Stupid boy. Now the Tarlys bend the knee like everyone else. He could have lingered on the edge of the battle with the smart boys and today his wife would be making him miserable, his sons would be ingrates, and he\\'d be waking three times in the night to piss into a bowl.

They know their country better than we do. They knew there was a storm coming in. So they hid in their caves and waited for it to pass. And we got caught in the open. Wind so strong it yanked 100-foot trees straight from the ground, roots and all. If you took your gloves off to find your cock to have a piss, you lost a finger to the frost. And all in darkness. You don't know cold. Neither of you do. The horses died first. We didn't have enough to feed them, to keep them warm. Eating the horses was easy. But later when we started to fall... That wasn't easy. We should have had a couple of boys like you along, shouldn't we? Soft, fat boys like you. We'd have lasted a fortnight on you and still had bones leftover for soup. Soon we'll have new recruits and you lot will be passed along to the Lord Commander for assignment and they will call you men of the Night's Watch, but you'd be fools to believe it.

Gregor found his little brother playing with a toy by the fire... Gregor's toy, a wooden knight.

We couldn't bear to be inside, so we ran down to the Rhoyne. Every child in Volantis was in the Rhoyne that day. The rich, the poor, we were all there. Naked, screaming, racing to the little islands. Drummers were playing for coppers on the east bank. I was treading water, talking to a friend, when I realized I hadn't seen my brother. I called his name. Then I started screaming his name. And then I saw him floating face down. My heart just stopped. I was I dragged him from the water. My friend helped me, I think. I don't even remember. He was so little. Then we pulled him onto the riverbank. And I screamed at him and I shook him. And he was dead. Just dead. A man ran over. He had a fish tattoo on his face. In Volantis, the slaves have tattoos. So you know what they are without having to talk to them. And this man worked on a fishing boat. And he pushed me out of the way. You have to understand, for a slave to push a highborn girl, that's death for the man, a terrible death. But he pushed me out of the way, and he started pressing on my brother's chest again and again and again, until my brother spat out half of the Rhoyne and cried out. And the man cradled his head and told him to be calm. I decided two things that day. I would not waste my years planning dances and masquerades with the other noble ladies. And when I came of age, I would never live in a slave city again. I'm sorry, Your Grace.

I feared the man meant to use me as I'd heard some men used small boys. But what he wanted was far worse. He gave me a potion that made me powerless to move or speak, yet did nothing to dull my senses. With a hooked blade he sliced me, root and stem, chanting all the while. He burned my parts in a brazier. The flames turned blue and I heard a voice answer his call. I still dream of that night. Not of the sorcerer, not of his blade. I dream of the voice from the flames. Was it a god? A demon? A conjurer's trick? I don't know. But the sorcerer called and a voice answered. And ever since that day, I have hated magic and all those who practice it.

Step by step, one distasteful task after another, I made my way from the slums of Myr to the small council chamber. Influence grows like a weed. I tended mine patiently until its tendrils reached from the Red Keep all the way across to the far side of the world where I managed to wrap them around something very special.\", 8340: 'The sorcerer.', 8341: \"Hello, my old friend.

She killed them as much as I.', 8629: 'My mother had nothing to do with this. This was your treason.', 8630: \"It's treason to free your enemies. In war, you kill your enemies. Did your father not teach you that, boy?\", 8631: 'Leave him.', 8632: \"Aye. Leave me to the king. He wants to give me a scolding before he sets me free. That's how he deals with treason. Our King in the North. Or should I call him the King Who Lost the North?\", 8633: 'Escort Lord Karstark to the dungeon. Hang the rest.', 8634: \"Mercy, sire! I didn't kill anyone.

You're supposed to get me to King's Landing in one piece. Not going so well, is it? No wonder Renly died with you guarding him.\", 8729: 'That was unworthy. Forgive me.

Let's call a truce.\", 8732: 'You need trust to have a truce.', 8733: 'I trust you.', 8734: \"There it is. There's the look. I've seen it for seventeen years on face after face. You all despise me. Kingslayer. Oathbreaker. A man without honor. You've heard of wildfire?\", 8735: 'Of course.', 8736: \"The Mad King was obsessed with it. He loved to watch people burn, the way their skin blackened and blistered and melted off their bones. He burned lords he didn't like. He burned Hands who disobeyed him. He burned anyone who was against him. Before long, half the country was against him. Aerys saw traitors everywhere. So he had his pyromancer place caches of wildfire all over the city- beneath the Sept of Baelor and the slums of Flea Bottom. Under houses, stables, taverns. Even beneath the Red Keep itself. Finally, the day of reckoning came. Robert Baratheon marched on the capital after his victory at the Trident. But my father arrived first with the whole Lannister army at his back, promising to defend the city against the rebels. I knew my father better than that. He's never been one to pick the losing side. I told the Mad King as much. I urged him to surrender peacefully. But the king didn't listen to me. He didn't listen to Varys who tried to warn him. But he did listen to Grand Maester Pycelle, that grey, sunken cunt. 'You can trust the Lannisters,' he said. 'The Lannisters have always been true friends of the crown.' So we opened the gates and my father sacked the city. Once again, I came to the king, begging him to surrender. He told me to bring him my father's head. Then he turned to his pyromancer. 'Burn them all,' he said. 'Burn them in their homes. Burn them in their beds.' Tell me, if your precious Renly commanded you to kill your own father and stand by while thousands of men, women, and children burned alive, would you have done it? Would you have kept your oath then?\", 8737: \"First, I killed the pyromancer. And then when the king turned to flee, I drove my sword into his back. 'Burn them all,' he kept saying. 'Burn them all.' I don't think he expected to die. He- he meant to burn with the rest of us and rise again, reborn as a dragon to turn his enemies to ash. I slit his throat to make sure that didn't happen. That's where Ned Stark found me.\", 8738: \"If this is true why didn't you tell anyone? Why didn't you tell Lord Stark?\", 8739: 'Stark? You think the honorable Ned Stark wanted to hear my side? He judged me guilty the moment he set eyes on me. By what right does the wolf judge the lion? By what right?', 8740: 'Help! Help! The Kingslayer!', 8741: 'Jaime. My name is Jaime.', 8742: 'Onion Knight. Ser Onion Knight.', 8743: 'Princess? Gods, what are you doing here?', 8744: \"Shh, you'll wake Bert.\", 8745: 'Bert?', 8746: \"He's the fat one.

Are you?', 8749: \"I am, child. I disobeyed my king, your father, and now I'm paying the price.\", 8750: \"I don't care. You're my friend. You must get bored down here. I brought you something to read. It's about Aegon and his dragons. Aegon used to live here. Did you know that? And the Targaryens built this castle.\", 8751: 'Aye. So they did.', 8752: \"You can hide the book under your cloak. It's a good one. I'll bring you more.\", 8753: \"Thank you, my lady. I'm sure it's a fine book, but it's wasted on me.\", 8754: 'Take it. I have more.', 8755: \"My lady, I can't read the words.\", 8756: \"You can't?\", 8757: \"I'll teach you.

I was very nearly the first man knighted to piss on the king's boots.\", 8770: 'Robert would have laughed. He was a good man, a great warrior. And a terrible king. I burned away my years fighting for terrible kings.', 8771: 'You swore an oath.', 8772: \"Yes. And a man of honor keeps his vows, even if he's serving a drunk or a lunatic. Just once in my life before it's over, I want to know what it's like to serve with pride, to fight for someone I believe in. Do you believe in her?\", 8773: 'With all my heart.', 8774: 'These are the ones?', 8775: 'Yes, khaleesi. The officers.', 8776: 'You did not choose this life. But you are free men now.

Choose the name your parents gave you, or any other. A name that gives you pride.', 8784: 'Grey Worm\" gives me pride. It is a very lucky name. The name this one was born with was cursed. That was the name he had when he was taken as a slave. But Grey Worm is the name this one had the day Daenerys Stormborn set him free.', 8785: 'King Robert wanted her dead.', 8786: \"Of course he wanted her dead. She's a Targaryen.

A plaything for Joffrey to torture or Queen Cersei to torment. They beat me, they humiliated me, they married me to the Imp. I had no friends in King's Landing...except one. He saved me. Smuggled me away when he had the chance. He knew I'd be safe here in the Eyrie with my own blood, my Aunt Lysa. The Lannisters have friends everywhere. Even the Vale.

She told me herself. From the moment he arrived at the gates of Riverrun, a boy of eight carrying everything he owned in a little sack. She confessed to me she never loved Lord Arryn. She did as her father commanded, as so many of us have. When the gods finally allowed her to be with Lord Baelish, she was so happy. For a time. My aunt was a jealous lady. She was terrified that Lord Baelish didn't love her anymore. That he would abandon her for a younger woman. And then...one day she saw him kiss me.\", 13402: 'Lady Sansa.', 13403: \"It was a peck on the cheek, Lord Royce, nothing more. Lord Baelish is my uncle now, in truth, by marriage. He's always been so kind to me. I was so happy to be here, to be free. All because of him. But my aunt turned on me. She cursed me. Called me a whore. Promised to throw me through the Moon Door. When Lord Baelish tried to calm her, she struck him. She said she didn't want to live anymore. She stood on the edge of that Moon Door. He tried to reason with her. Promised her she was the only one he had ever loved, but she stepped through those doors and she was...*begins sobbing*\", 13404: \"Shh. Shh, it's not your fault, sweet girl.

I may not have been able to speak with Orson, but I could observe him, watch him the way men watch animals to come to a deeper understanding of their behavior. *picks up a beetle* And as I watched, I became more and more sure of it. There was something happening there. His face was like the page of a book written in a language I didn\\'t understand. But he wasn\\'t mindless. He had his reasons. And I became possessed with knowing what they were. I began to spend inordinate amounts of time watching him. I would eat my lunch in the garden, chewing my mutton to the music of \"khuu, khuu, khuu\". And when I wasn\\'t watching him, I was thinking about him. Father droned on about the family legacy and I thought about Orson\\'s beetles. I read the histories of Targaryen conquests. Did I hear dragon wings? No. I heard \"khuu, khuu, khuu\" and I still couldn\\'t figure out why he was doing it.

And here Ser Gregor is stronger than ever. That must be difficult for you. When my daughter was taken from me, my only daughter, well, you can't imagine how that feels unless you've lost a child. I fed her at my own breast even though they told me to give her to the wet nurse. I couldn't bear to see her in another woman's arms. I never got to have a mother. But Myrcella did.

for to supply her loss , he invited and received into his house the family of his nephew mr. henry dashwood , the legal inheritor of the norland estate , and the person to whom he intended to bequeath it . </s>', \"<s> in the society of his nephew and niece , and their children , the old gentleman 's days were comfortably spent . </s>\", '<s> his attachment to them all increased . </s>', '<s> the constant attention of mr. and mrs. henry dashwood to his wishes , which proceeded not merely from interest , but from goodness of heart , gave him every degree of solid comfort which his age could receive ; and the cheerfulness of the children added a relish to his existence . </s>', '<s> by a former marriage , mr. henry dashwood had one son : by his present lady , three daughters . </s>', '<s> the son , a steady respectable young man , was amply provided for by the fortune of his mother , which had been large , and half of which devolved on him on his coming of age . </s>', '<s> by his own marriage , likewise , which happened soon afterwards , he added to his wealth . </s>', \"<s> to him therefore the succession to the norland estate was not so really important as to his sisters ; for their fortune , independent of what might arise to them from their father 's inheriting that property , could be but small . </s>\", \"<s> their mother had nothing , and their father only seven thousand pounds in his own disposal ; for the remaining moiety of his first wife 's fortune was also secured to her child , and he had only a life - interest in it . </s>\", '<s> the old gentleman died : his will was read , and like almost every other will , gave as much disappointment as pleasure . </s>', '<s> he was neither so unjust , nor so ungrateful , as to leave his estate from his nephew ; but he left it to him on such terms as destroyed half the value of the bequest . </s>', \"<s> mr. dashwood had wished for it more for the sake of his wife and daughters than for himself or his son ; but to his son , and his son 's son , a child of four years old , it was secured , in such a way , as to leave to himself no power of providing for those who were most dear to him , and who most needed a provision by any charge on the estate , or by any sale of its valuable woods . </s>\", '<s> the whole was tied up for the benefit of this child , who , in occasional visits with his father and mother at norland , had so far gained on the affections of his uncle , by such attractions as are by no means unusual in children of two or three years old ; an imperfect articulation , an earnest desire of having his own way , many cunning tricks , and a great deal of noise , as to outweigh all the value of all the attention which , for years , he had received from his niece and her daughters . </s>', '<s> he meant not to be unkind , however , and , as a mark of his affection for the three girls , he left them a thousand pounds a - piece . </s>', \"<s> mr. dashwood 's disappointment was , at first , severe ; but his temper was cheerful and sanguine ; and he might reasonably hope to live many years , and by living economically , lay by a considerable sum from the produce of an estate already large , and capable of almost immediate improvement . </s>\", '<s> but the fortune , which had been so tardy in coming , was his only one twelvemonth . </s>', '<s> he survived his uncle no longer ; and ten thousand pounds , including the late legacies , was all that remained for his widow and daughters . </s>', '<s> his son was sent for as soon as his danger was known , and to him mr. dashwood recommended , with all the strength and urgency which illness could command , the interest of his mother - in - law and sisters . </s>', '<s> mr. john dashwood had not the strong feelings of the rest of the family ; but he was affected by a recommendation of such a nature at such a time , and he promised to do every thing in his power to make them comfortable . </s>', '<s> his father was rendered easy by such an assurance , and mr. john dashwood had then leisure to consider how much there might prudently be in his power to do for them . </s>', \"<s> [ illustration : _ his son 's son , a child of four years old . _ ] </s>\", '<s> he was not an ill - disposed young man , unless to be rather cold hearted and rather selfish is to be ill - disposed : but he was , in general , well respected ; for he conducted himself with propriety in the discharge of his ordinary duties . </s>', '<s> had he married a more amiable woman , he might have been made still more respectable than he was : he might even have been made amiable himself ; for he was very young when he married , and very fond of his wife . </s>', '<s> but mrs. john dashwood was a strong caricature of himself ; more narrow - minded and selfish . </s>', '<s> when he gave his promise to his father , he meditated within himself to increase the fortunes of his sisters by the present of a thousand pounds a - piece . </s>', '<s> he then really thought himself equal to it . </s>', \"<s> the prospect of four thousand a - year , in addition to his present income , besides the remaining half of his own mother 's fortune , warmed his heart , and made him feel capable of generosity . </s>\", '<s> yes , he would give them three thousand pounds : it would be liberal and handsome ! </s>', '<s> it would be enough to make them completely easy . </s>', '<s> three thousand pounds ! </s>', '<s> he could spare so considerable a sum with little inconvenience . </s>', '<s> he thought of it all day long , and for many days successively , and he did not repent . </s>', \"<s> no sooner was his father 's funeral over , than mrs. john dashwood , without sending any notice of her intention to her mother - in - law , arrived with her child and their attendants . </s>\", \"<s> no one could dispute her right to come ; the house was her husband 's from the moment of his father 's decease ; but the indelicacy of her conduct was so much the greater , and to a woman in mrs. dashwood 's situation , with only common feelings , must have been highly unpleasing . </s>\", '<s> but in _ her _ mind there was a sense of honor so keen , a generosity so romantic , that any offence of the kind , by whomsoever given or received , was to her a source of immovable disgust . </s>', \"<s> mrs. john dashwood had never been a favourite with any of her husband 's family ; but she had had no opportunity , till the present , of showing them with how little attention to the comfort of other people she could act when occasion required it . </s>\", '<s> so acutely did mrs. dashwood feel this ungracious behaviour , and so earnestly did she despise her daughter - in - law for it , that , on the arrival of the latter , she would have quitted the house for ever , had not the entreaty of her eldest girl induced her first to reflect on the propriety of going , and her own tender love for all her three children determined her afterwards to stay , and for their sakes avoid a breach with their brother . </s>', '<s> elinor , this eldest daughter , whose advice was so effectual , possessed a strength of understanding , and coolness of judgment , which qualified her , though only nineteen , to be the counsellor of her mother , and enabled her frequently to counteract , to the advantage of them all , that eagerness of mind in mrs. dashwood which must generally have led to imprudence . </s>', '<s> she had an excellent heart ;

not from any disinclination to move when the sight of every well known spot ceased to raise the violent emotion which it produced for a while ; for when her spirits began to revive , and her mind became capable of some other exertion than that of heightening its affliction by melancholy remembrances , she was impatient to be gone , and indefatigable in her inquiries for a suitable dwelling in the neighbourhood of norland ; for to remove far from that beloved spot was impossible . </s>', '<s> but she could hear of no situation that at once answered her notions of comfort and ease , and suited the prudence of her eldest daughter , whose steadier judgment rejected several houses as too large for their income , which her mother would have approved . </s>', '<s> [ illustration : \" _ i can not imagine how they will spend half of it . _ \" ] </s>', '<s> mrs. dashwood had been informed by her husband of the solemn promise on the part of his son in their favour , which gave comfort to his last earthly reflections . </s>', \"<s> she doubted the sincerity of this assurance no more than he had doubted it himself , and she thought of it for her daughters ' sake with satisfaction , though as for herself she was persuaded that a much smaller provision than 7000l would support her in affluence . </s>\", \"<s> for their brother 's sake , too , for the sake of his own heart , she rejoiced ;

more especially at a moment when she was suffering under the cold and unfeeling behaviour of her nearer connections . </s>', '<s> she needed no time for deliberation or inquiry . </s>', '<s> her resolution was formed as she read . </s>', '<s> the situation of barton , in a county so far distant from sussex as devonshire , which , but a few hours before , would have been a sufficient objection to outweigh every possible advantage belonging to the place , was now its first recommendation . </s>', \"<s> to quit the neighbourhood of norland was no longer an evil ; it was an object of desire ; it was a blessing , in comparison of the misery of continuing her daughter - in - law 's guest ; and to remove for ever from that beloved place would be less painful than to inhabit or visit it while such a woman was its mistress . </s>\", '<s> she instantly wrote sir john middleton her acknowledgment of his kindness , and her acceptance of his proposal ; and then hastened to show both letters to her daughters , that she might be secure of their approbation before her answer were sent . </s>', '<s> elinor had always thought it would be more prudent for them to settle at some distance from norland , than immediately amongst their present acquaintance . </s>', \"<s> on _ that _ head , therefore , it was not for her to oppose her mother 's intention of removing into devonshire . </s>\", '<s> the house , too , as described by sir john , was on so simple a scale , and the rent so uncommonly moderate , as to leave her no right of objection on either point ; and , therefore , though it was not a plan which brought any charm to her fancy , though it was a removal from the vicinity of norland beyond her wishes , she made no attempt to dissuade her mother from sending a letter of acquiescence . </s>', '<s> no sooner was her answer dispatched , than mrs. dashwood indulged herself in the pleasure of announcing to her son - in - law and his wife that she was provided with a house , and should incommode them no longer than till every thing were ready for her inhabiting it . </s>', '<s> they heard her with surprise . </s>', '<s> mrs. john dashwood said nothing ; but her husband civilly hoped that she would not be settled far from norland . </s>', '<s> she had great satisfaction in replying that she was going into devonshire . </s>', '<s> edward turned hastily towards her , on hearing this , and , in a voice of surprise and concern , which required no explanation to her , repeated , \" devonshire ! </s>', '<s> are you , indeed , going there ? </s>', '<s> so far from hence ! </s>', '<s> and to what part of it ? \" </s>', '<s> she explained the situation . </s>', '<s> it was within four miles northward of exeter . </s>', '<s> \" it is but a cottage , \" she continued , \" but i hope to see many of my friends in it . </s>', '<s> a room or two can easily be added ; and if my friends find no difficulty in travelling so far to see me , i am sure i will find none in accommodating them . \" </s>', '<s> she concluded with a very kind invitation to mr. and mrs. john dashwood to visit her at barton ; and to edward she gave one with still greater affection . </s>', '<s> though her late conversation with her daughter - in - law had made her resolve on remaining at norland no longer than was unavoidable , it had not produced the smallest effect on her in that point to which it principally tended . </s>', '<s> to separate edward and elinor was as far from being her object as ever ; and she wished to show mrs. john dashwood , by this pointed invitation to her brother , how totally she disregarded her disapprobation of the match . </s>', '<s> mr. john dashwood told his mother again and again how exceedingly sorry he was that she had taken a house at such a distance from norland as to prevent his being of any service to her in removing her furniture . </s>', '<s> he really felt conscientiously vexed on the occasion ; for the very exertion to which he had limited the performance of his promise to his father was by this arrangement rendered impracticable . </s>', '<s> the furniture was all sent around by water . </s>', \"<s> it chiefly consisted of household linen , plate , china , and books , with a handsome pianoforte of marianne 's . </s>\", \"<s> mrs. john dashwood saw the packages depart with a sigh : she could not help feeling it hard that as mrs. dashwood 's income would be so trifling in comparison with their own , she should have any handsome article of furniture . </s>\", '<s> mrs. dashwood took the house for a twelvemonth ; it was ready furnished , and she might have immediate possession . </s>', '<s> no difficulty arose on either side in the agreement ; and she waited only for the disposal of her effects at norland , and to determine her future household , before she set off for the west ; and this , as she was exceedingly rapid in the performance of everything that interested her , was soon done . </s>', '<s> the horses which were left her by her husband had been sold soon after his death , and an opportunity now offering of disposing of her carriage , she agreed to sell that likewise at the earnest advice of her eldest daughter . </s>', '<s> for the comfort of her children , had she consulted only her own wishes , she would have kept it ; but the discretion of elinor prevailed . </s>', '<s> _ her _ wisdom too limited the number of their servants to three ; two maids and a man , with whom they were speedily provided from amongst those who had formed their establishment at norland . </s>', \"<s> the man and one of the maids were sent off immediately into devonshire , to prepare the house for their mistress 's arrival ; for as lady middleton was entirely unknown to mrs. dashwood , she preferred going directly to the cottage to being a visitor at barton park ; and she relied so undoubtingly on sir john 's description of the house , as to feel no curiosity to examine it herself till she entered it as her own . </s>\", '<s> her eagerness to be gone from norland was preserved from diminution by the evident satisfaction of her daughter - in - law in the prospect of her removal ; a satisfaction which was but feebly attempted to be concealed under a cold invitation to her to defer her departure . </s>', \"<s> now was the time when her son - in - law 's promise to his father might with particular propriety be fulfilled . </s>\", '<s> since he had neglected to do it on first coming to the estate , their quitting his house might be looked on as the most suitable period for its accomplishment . </s>', '<s> but mrs. dashwood began shortly to give over every hope of the kind , and to be convinced , from the general drift of his discourse , that his assistance extended no farther than their maintenance for six months at norland . </s>', '<s> he so frequently talked of the increasing expenses of housekeeping , and of the perpetual demands upon his purse , which a man of any consequence in the world was beyond calculation exposed to , that he seemed rather to stand in need of more money himself than to have any design of giving money away . </s>', \"<s> in a very few weeks from the day which brought sir john middleton 's first letter to norland , every thing was so far settled in their future abode as to enable mrs. dashwood and her daughters to begin their journey . </s>\", '<s> many were the tears shed by them in their last adieus to a place so much beloved . </s>', '<s> \" dear , dear norland ! \" said marianne , as she wandered alone before the house , on the last evening of their being there ; \" when shall i cease to regret you!--when learn to feel a home elsewhere ! </s>', '<s> oh ! happy house , could you know what i suffer in now viewing you from this spot , from whence perhaps i may view you no more ! </s>', '<s> and you , ye well - known trees!--but you will continue the same . </s>', '<s> no leaf will decay because we are removed , nor any branch become motionless although we can observe you no longer ! </s>', '<s> no ; you will continue the same ; unconscious of the pleasure or the regret you occasion , and insensible of any change in those who walk under your shade ! </s>', '<s> but who will remain to enjoy you ? \" </s>', '<s> the first part of their journey was performed in too melancholy a disposition to be otherwise than tedious and unpleasant . </s>', '<s> but as they drew towards the end of it , their interest in the appearance of a country which they were to inhabit overcame their dejection , and a view of barton valley as they entered it gave them cheerfulness . </s>', '<s> it was a pleasant fertile spot , well wooded , and rich in pasture . </s>', '<s> after winding along it for more than a mile , they reached their own house . </s>', '<s> a small green court was the whole of its demesne in front ; and a neat wicket gate admitted them into it . </s>', '<s> as a house , barton cottage , though small , was comfortable and compact ; but as a cottage it was defective , for the building was regular , the roof was tiled , the window shutters were not painted green , nor were the walls covered with honeysuckles . </s>', '<s> a narrow passage led directly through the house into the garden behind . </s>', '<s> on each side of the entrance was a sitting room , about sixteen feet square ; and beyond them were the offices and the stairs . </s>', '<s> four bedrooms and two garrets formed the rest of the house . </s>', '<s> it had not been built many years and was in good repair . </s>', '<s> in comparison of norland , it was poor and small indeed!--but the tears which recollection called forth as they entered the house were soon dried away . </s>', '<s> they were cheered by the joy of the servants on their arrival , and each for the sake of the others resolved to appear happy . </s>', '<s> it was very early in september ; the season was fine , and from first seeing the place under the advantage of good weather , they received an impression in its favour which was of material service in recommending it to their lasting approbation . </s>', '<s> the situation of the house was good . </s>', '<s> high hills rose immediately behind , and at no great distance on each side ; some of which were open downs , the others cultivated and woody . </s>', '<s> the village of barton was chiefly on one of these hills , and formed a pleasant view from the cottage windows . </s>', '<s> the prospect in front was more extensive ; it commanded the whole of the valley , and reached into the country beyond . </s>', '<s> the hills which surrounded the cottage terminated the valley in that direction ; under another name , and in another course , it branched out again between two of the steepest of them . </s>', '<s> with the size and furniture of the house mrs. dashwood was upon the whole well satisfied ; for though her former style of life rendered many additions to the latter indispensable , yet to add and improve was a delight to her ; and she had at this time ready money enough to supply all that was wanted of greater elegance to the apartments . </s>', '<s> \" as for the house itself , to be sure , \" said she , \" it is too small for our family , but we will make ourselves tolerably comfortable for the present , as it is too late in the year for improvements . </s>', '<s> perhaps in the spring , if i have plenty of money , as i dare say i shall , we may think about building . </s>', '<s> these parlors are both too small for such parties of our friends as i hope to see often collected here ; and i have some thoughts of throwing the passage into one of them with perhaps a part of the other , and so leave the remainder of that other for an entrance ; this , with a new drawing room which may be easily added , and a bed - chamber and garret above , will make it a very snug little cottage . </s>', '<s> i could wish the stairs were handsome . </s>', '<s> but one must not expect every thing ; though i suppose it would be no difficult matter to widen them . </s>', '<s> i shall see how much i am before - hand with the world in the spring , and we will plan our improvements accordingly . \" </s>', '<s> in the mean time , till all these alterations could be made from the savings of an income of five hundred a - year by a woman who never saved in her life , they were wise enough to be contented with the house as it was ; and each of them was busy in arranging their particular concerns , and endeavoring , by placing around them books and other possessions , to form themselves a home . </s>', \"<s> marianne 's pianoforte was unpacked and properly disposed of ; and elinor 's drawings were affixed to the walls of their sitting room . </s>\", '<s> in such employments as these they were interrupted soon after breakfast the next day by the entrance of their landlord , who called to welcome them to barton , and to offer them every accommodation from his own house and garden in which theirs might at present be deficient . </s>', '<s> sir john middleton was a good looking man about forty . </s>', '<s> he had formerly visited at stanhill , but it was too long for his young cousins to remember him . </s>', '<s> his countenance was thoroughly good - humoured ; and his manners were as friendly as the style of his letter . </s>', '<s> their arrival seemed to afford him real satisfaction , and their comfort to be an object of real solicitude to him . </s>', '<s> he said much of his earnest desire of their living in the most sociable terms with his family , and pressed them so cordially to dine at barton park every day till they were better settled at home , that , though his entreaties were carried to a point of perseverance beyond civility , they could not give offence . </s>', '<s> his kindness was not confined to words ; for within an hour after he left them , a large basket full of garden stuff and fruit arrived from the park , which was followed before the end of the day by a present of game . </s>', '<s> he insisted , moreover , on conveying all their letters to and from the post for them , and would not be denied the satisfaction of sending them his newspaper every day . </s>', '<s> lady middleton had sent a very civil message by him , denoting her intention of waiting on mrs. dashwood as soon as she could be assured that her visit would be no inconvenience ; and as this message was answered by an invitation equally polite , her ladyship was introduced to them the next day . </s>', '<s> [ illustration : _ so shy before company . _ ] </s>', '<s> they were , of course , very anxious to see a person on whom so much of their comfort at barton must depend ; and the elegance of her appearance was favourable to their wishes . </s>', '<s> lady middleton was not more than six or seven and twenty ; her face was handsome , her figure tall and striking , and her address graceful . </s>', \"<s> her manners had all the elegance which her husband 's wanted . </s>\", '<s> but they would have been improved by some share of his frankness and warmth ; and her visit was long enough to detract something from their first admiration , by showing that , though perfectly well - bred , she was reserved , cold , and had nothing to say for herself beyond the most common - place inquiry or remark . </s>', '<s> conversation however was not wanted , for sir john was very chatty , and lady middleton had taken the wise precaution of bringing with her their eldest child , a fine little boy about six years old , by which means there was one subject always to be recurred to by the ladies in case of extremity , for they had to enquire his name and age , admire his beauty , and ask him questions which his mother answered for him , while he hung about her and held down his head , to the great surprise of her ladyship , who wondered at his being so shy before company , as he could make noise enough at home . </s>', '<s> on every formal visit a child ought to be of the party , by way of provision for discourse . </s>', '<s> in the present case it took up ten minutes to determine whether the boy were most like his father or mother , and in what particular he resembled either , for of course every body differed , and every body was astonished at the opinion of the others . </s>', '<s> an opportunity was soon to be given to the dashwoods of debating on the rest of the children , as sir john would not leave the house without securing their promise of dining at the park the next day . </s>', '<s> barton park was about half a mile from the cottage . </s>', '<s> the ladies had passed near it in their way along the valley , but it was screened from their view at home by the projection of a hill . </s>', '<s> the house was large and handsome ; and the middletons lived in a style of equal hospitality and elegance . </s>', \"<s> the former was for sir john 's gratification , the latter for that of his lady . </s>\", '<s> they were scarcely ever without some friends staying with them in the house , and they kept more company of every kind than any other family in the neighbourhood . </s>', '<s> it was necessary to the happiness of both ; for however dissimilar in temper and outward behaviour , they strongly resembled each other in that total want of talent and taste which confined their employments , unconnected with such as society produced , within a very narrow compass . </s>', '<s> sir john was a sportsman , lady middleton a mother . </s>', '<s> he hunted and shot , and she humoured her children ; and these were their only resources . </s>', \"<s> lady middleton had the advantage of being able to spoil her children all the year round , while sir john 's independent employments were in existence only half the time . </s>\", '<s> continual engagements at home and abroad , however , supplied all the deficiencies of nature and education ; supported the good spirits of sir john , and gave exercise to the good breeding of his wife . </s>', '<s> lady middleton piqued herself upon the elegance of her table , and of all her domestic arrangements ; and from this kind of vanity was her greatest enjoyment in any of their parties . </s>', \"<s> but sir john 's satisfaction in society was much more real ; he delighted in collecting about him more young people than his house would hold , and the noisier they were the better was he pleased . </s>\", '<s> he was a blessing to all the juvenile part of the neighbourhood , </s>', '<s> for in summer he was for ever forming parties to eat cold ham and chicken out of doors , and in winter his private balls were numerous enough for any young lady who was not suffering under the insatiable appetite of fifteen . </s>', '<s> the arrival of a new family in the country was always a matter of joy to him , and in every point of view he was charmed with the inhabitants he had now procured for his cottage at barton . </s>', '<s> the miss dashwoods were young , pretty , and unaffected . </s>', '<s> it was enough to secure his good opinion ; for to be unaffected was all that a pretty girl could want to make her mind as captivating as her person . </s>', '<s> the friendliness of his disposition made him happy in accommodating those , whose situation might be considered , in comparison with the past , as unfortunate . </s>', '<s> in showing kindness to his cousins therefore he had the real satisfaction of a good heart ; and in settling a family of females only in his cottage , he had all the satisfaction of a sportsman ; for a sportsman , though he esteems only those of his sex who are sportsmen likewise , is not often desirous of encouraging their taste by admitting them to a residence within his own manor . </s>', '<s> mrs. dashwood and her daughters were met at the door of the house by sir john , who welcomed them to barton park with unaffected sincerity ; and as he attended them to the drawing room repeated to the young ladies the concern which the same subject had drawn from him the day before , at being unable to get any smart young men to meet them . </s>', '<s> they would see , he said , only one gentleman there besides himself ; a particular friend who was staying at the park , but who was neither very young nor very gay . </s>', '<s> he hoped they would all excuse the smallness of the party , and could assure them it should never happen so again . </s>', '<s> he had been to several families that morning in hopes of procuring some addition to their number , but it was moonlight and every body was full of engagements . </s>', \"<s> luckily lady middleton 's mother had arrived at barton within the last hour , and as she was a very cheerful agreeable woman , he hoped the young ladies would not find it so very dull as they might imagine . </s>\", '<s> the young ladies , as well as their mother , were perfectly satisfied with having two entire strangers of the party , and wished for no more . </s>', \"<s> mrs. jennings , lady middleton 's mother , was a good - humoured , merry , fat , elderly woman , who talked a great deal , seemed very happy , and rather vulgar . </s>\", '<s> she was full of jokes and laughter , and before dinner was over had said many witty things on the subject of lovers and husbands ; hoped they had not left their hearts behind them in sussex , and pretended to see them blush whether they did or not . </s>', \"<s> marianne was vexed at it for her sister 's sake , and turned her eyes towards elinor to see how she bore these attacks , with an earnestness which gave elinor far more pain than could arise from such common - place raillery as mrs. jennings 's . </s>\", \"<s> colonel brandon , the friend of sir john , seemed no more adapted by resemblance of manner to be his friend , than lady middleton was to be his wife , or mrs. jennings to be lady middleton 's mother . </s>\", '<s> he was silent and grave . </s>', '<s> his appearance however was not unpleasing , in spite of his being in the opinion of marianne and margaret an absolute old bachelor , for he was on the wrong side of five and thirty ; but though his face was not handsome , his countenance was sensible , and his address was particularly gentlemanlike . </s>', '<s> there was nothing in any of the party which could recommend them as companions to the dashwoods ; but the cold insipidity of lady middleton was so particularly repulsive , that in comparison of it the gravity of colonel brandon , and even the boisterous mirth of sir john and his mother - in - law was interesting . </s>', '<s> lady middleton seemed to be roused to enjoyment only by the entrance of her four noisy children after dinner , who pulled her about , tore her clothes , and put an end to every kind of discourse except what related to themselves . </s>', '<s> in the evening , as marianne was discovered to be musical , she was invited to play . </s>', \"<s> the instrument was unlocked , every body prepared to be charmed , and marianne , who sang very well , at their request went through the chief of the songs which lady middleton had brought into the family on her marriage , and which perhaps had lain ever since in the same position on the pianoforte , for her ladyship had celebrated that event by giving up music , although by her mother 's account , she had played extremely well , and by her own was very fond of it . </s>\", \"<s> marianne 's performance was highly applauded . </s>\", '<s> sir john was loud in his admiration at the end of every song , and as loud in his conversation with the others while every song lasted . </s>', \"<s> lady middleton frequently called him to order , wondered how any one 's attention could be diverted from music for a moment , and asked marianne to sing a particular song which marianne had just finished . </s>\", '<s> colonel brandon alone , of all the party , heard her without being in raptures . </s>', '<s> he paid her only the compliment of attention ; and she felt a respect for him on the occasion , which the others had reasonably forfeited by their shameless want of taste . </s>', '<s> his pleasure in music , though it amounted not to that ecstatic delight which alone could sympathize with her own , was estimable when contrasted against the horrible insensibility of the others ; and she was reasonable enough to allow that a man of five and thirty might well have outlived all acuteness of feeling and every exquisite power of enjoyment . </s>', \"<s> she was perfectly disposed to make every allowance for the colonel 's advanced state of life which humanity required . </s>\", '<s> mrs. jennings was a widow with an ample jointure . </s>', '<s> she had only two daughters , both of whom she had lived to see respectably married , and she had now therefore nothing to do but to marry all the rest of the world . </s>', '<s> in the promotion of this object she was zealously active , as far as her ability reached ; and missed no opportunity of projecting weddings among all the young people of her acquaintance . </s>', '<s> she was remarkably quick in the discovery of attachments , and had enjoyed the advantage of raising the blushes and the vanity of many a young lady by insinuations of her power over such a young man ; and this kind of discernment enabled her soon after her arrival at barton decisively to pronounce that colonel brandon was very much in love with marianne dashwood . </s>', \"<s> she rather suspected it to be so , on the very first evening of their being together , from his listening so attentively while she sang to them ; and when the visit was returned by the middletons ' dining at the cottage , the fact was ascertained by his listening to her again . </s>\", '<s> it must be so . </s>', '<s> she was perfectly convinced of it . </s>', '<s> it would be an excellent match , for _ he _ was rich , and _ she _ was handsome . </s>', '<s> mrs. jennings had been anxious to see colonel brandon well married , ever since her connection with sir john first brought him to her knowledge ; and she was always anxious to get a good husband for every pretty girl . </s>', '<s> the immediate advantage to herself was by no means inconsiderable , for it supplied her with endless jokes against them both . </s>', '<s> at the park she laughed at the colonel , and in the cottage at marianne . </s>', \"<s> to the former her raillery was probably , as far as it regarded only himself , perfectly indifferent ; but to the latter it was at first incomprehensible ; and when its object was understood , she hardly knew whether most to laugh at its absurdity , or censure its impertinence , for she considered it as an unfeeling reflection on the colonel 's advanced years , and on his forlorn condition as an old bachelor . </s>\", '<s> mrs. dashwood , who could not think a man five years younger than herself , so exceedingly ancient as he appeared to the youthful fancy of her daughter , ventured to clear mrs. jennings from the probability of wishing to throw ridicule on his age . </s>', '<s> \" but at least , mamma , you can not deny the absurdity of the accusation , though you may not think it intentionally ill - natured . </s>', '<s> colonel brandon is certainly younger than mrs. jennings , but he is old enough to be _ my _ father ;

for , in spite of sir john 's urgent entreaties that they would mix more in the neighbourhood , and repeated assurances of his carriage being always at their service , the independence of mrs. dashwood 's spirit overcame the wish of society for her children ; and she was resolute in declining to visit any family beyond the distance of a walk . </s>\", '<s> there were but few who could be so classed ; and it was not all of them that were attainable . </s>', '<s> about a mile and a half from the cottage , along the narrow winding valley of allenham , which issued from that of barton , as formerly described , the girls had , in one of their earliest walks , discovered an ancient respectable looking mansion which , by reminding them a little of norland , interested their imagination and made them wish to be better acquainted with it . </s>', '<s> but they learnt , on enquiry , that its possessor , an elderly lady of very good character , was unfortunately too infirm to mix with the world , and never stirred from home . </s>', '<s> the whole country about them abounded in beautiful walks . </s>', '<s> the high downs which invited them from almost every window of the cottage to seek the exquisite enjoyment of air on their summits , were a happy alternative when the dirt of the valleys beneath shut up their superior beauties ; and towards one of these hills did marianne and margaret one memorable morning direct their steps , attracted by the partial sunshine of a showery sky , and unable longer to bear the confinement which the settled rain of the two preceding days had occasioned . </s>', \"<s> the weather was not tempting enough to draw the two others from their pencil and their book , in spite of marianne 's declaration that the day would be lastingly fair , and that every threatening cloud would be drawn off from their hills ; and the two girls set off together . </s>\", '<s> they gaily ascended the downs , rejoicing in their own penetration at every glimpse of blue sky ; and when they caught in their faces the animating gales of a high south - westerly wind , they pitied the fears which had prevented their mother and elinor from sharing such delightful sensations . </s>', '<s> \" is there a felicity in the world , \" said marianne , \" superior to this?--margaret , we will walk here at least two hours . \" </s>', '<s> margaret agreed , and they pursued their way against the wind , resisting it with laughing delight for about twenty minutes longer , when suddenly the clouds united over their heads , and a driving rain set full in their face . </s>', '<s> chagrined and surprised , they were obliged , though unwillingly , to turn back , for no shelter was nearer than their own house . </s>', '<s> one consolation however remained for them , to which the exigence of the moment gave more than usual propriety,--it was that of running with all possible speed down the steep side of the hill which led immediately to their garden gate . </s>', '<s> they set off . </s>', '<s> marianne had at first the advantage , but a false step brought her suddenly to the ground ; and margaret , unable to stop herself to assist her , was involuntarily hurried along , and reached the bottom in safety . </s>', '<s> a gentleman carrying a gun , with two pointers playing round him , was passing up the hill and within a few yards of marianne , when her accident happened . </s>', '<s> he put down his gun and ran to her assistance . </s>', '<s> she had raised herself from the ground , but her foot had been twisted in her fall , and she was scarcely able to stand . </s>', '<s> the gentleman offered his services ; and perceiving that her modesty declined what her situation rendered necessary , took her up in his arms without farther delay , and carried her down the hill . </s>', '<s> then passing through the garden , the gate of which had been left open by margaret , he bore her directly into the house , whither margaret was just arrived , and quitted not his hold till he had seated her in a chair in the parlour . </s>', '<s> elinor and her mother rose up in amazement at their entrance , and while the eyes of both were fixed on him with an evident wonder and a secret admiration which equally sprung from his appearance , he apologized for his intrusion by relating its cause , in a manner so frank and so graceful that his person , which was uncommonly handsome , received additional charms from his voice and expression . </s>', '<s> had he been even old , ugly , and vulgar , the gratitude and kindness of mrs. dashwood would have been secured by any act of attention to her child ; but the influence of youth , beauty , and elegance , gave an interest to the action which came home to her feelings . </s>', '<s> she thanked him again and again ; and , with a sweetness of address which always attended her , invited him to be seated . </s>', '<s> this he declined , as he was dirty and wet . </s>', '<s> mrs. dashwood then begged to know to whom she was obliged . </s>', '<s> his name , he replied , was willoughby , and his present home was at allenham , from whence he hoped she would allow him the honour of calling tomorrow to enquire after miss dashwood . </s>', '<s> the honour was readily granted , and he then departed , to make himself still more interesting , in the midst of a heavy rain . </s>', '<s> his manly beauty and more than common gracefulness were instantly the theme of general admiration , and the laugh which his gallantry raised against marianne received particular spirit from his exterior attractions . </s>', '<s> marianne herself had seen less of his person than the rest , for the confusion which crimsoned over her face , on his lifting her up , had robbed her of the power of regarding him after their entering the house . </s>', '<s> but she had seen enough of him to join in all the admiration of the others , and with an energy which always adorned her praise . </s>', '<s> his person and air were equal to what her fancy had ever drawn for the hero of a favourite story ; and in his carrying her into the house with so little previous formality , there was a rapidity of thought which particularly recommended the action to her . </s>', '<s> every circumstance belonging to him was interesting . </s>', '<s> his name was good , his residence was in their favourite village , and she soon found out that of all manly dresses a shooting - jacket was the most becoming . </s>', '<s> her imagination was busy , her reflections were pleasant , and the pain of a sprained ankle was disregarded . </s>', \"<s> sir john called on them as soon as the next interval of fair weather that morning allowed him to get out of doors ; and marianne 's accident being related to him , he was eagerly asked whether he knew any gentleman of the name of willoughby at allenham . </s>\", '<s> \" willoughby ! \" cried sir john ; \" what , is _ he _ in the country ? </s>', '<s> that is good news however ; i will ride over tomorrow , and ask him to dinner on thursday . \" </s>', '<s> \" you know him then , \" said mrs. dashwood . </s>', '<s> \" know him ! </s>', '<s> to be sure i do . </s>', '<s> why , he is down here every year . \" </s>', '<s> \" and what sort of a young man is he ? \" </s>', '<s> \" as good a kind of fellow as ever lived , i assure you . </s>', '<s> a very decent shot , and there is not a bolder rider in england . \" </s>', '<s> \" and is that all you can say for him ? \" cried marianne , indignantly . \" </s>', '<s> but what are his manners on more intimate acquaintance ? </s>', '<s> what his pursuits , his talents , and genius ? \" </s>', '<s> sir john was rather puzzled . </s>', '<s> \" upon my soul , \" said he , \" i do not know much about him as to all _ that . _ </s>', '<s> but he is a pleasant , good humoured fellow , and has got the nicest little black bitch of a pointer i ever saw . </s>', '<s> was she out with him today ? \" </s>', \"<s> but marianne could no more satisfy him as to the colour of mr. willoughby 's pointer , than he could describe to her the shades of his mind . </s>\", '<s> \" but who is he ? \" said elinor . </s>', '<s> \" where does he come from ? </s>', '<s> has he a house at allenham ? \" </s>', '<s> on this point sir john could give more certain intelligence ; and he told them that mr. willoughby had no property of his own in the country ; that he resided there only while he was visiting the old lady at allenham court , to whom he was related , and whose possessions he was to inherit ; adding , \" yes , yes , he is very well worth catching i can tell you , miss dashwood ; he has a pretty little estate of his own in somersetshire besides ; and if i were you , i would not give him up to my younger sister , in spite of all this tumbling down hills . </s>', '<s> miss marianne must not expect to have all the men to herself . </s>', '<s> brandon will be jealous , if she does not take care . \" </s>', '<s> \" i do not believe , \" said mrs. dashwood , with a good humoured smile , \" that mr. willoughby will be incommoded by the attempts of either of _ my _ daughters towards what you call _ catching him . </s>', '<s> _ it is not an employment to which they have been brought up . </s>', '<s> men are very safe with us , let them be ever so rich . </s>', '<s> i am glad to find , however , from what you say , that he is a respectable young man , and one whose acquaintance will not be ineligible . \" </s>', '<s> \" he is as good a sort of fellow , i believe , as ever lived , \" repeated sir john . </s>', '<s> \" i remember last christmas at a little hop at the park , he danced from eight o\\'clock till four , without once sitting down . \" </s>', '<s> \" did he indeed ? \" cried marianne with sparkling eyes , \" and with elegance , with spirit ? \" </s>', '<s> yes ; and he was up again at eight to ride to covert . \" </s>', '<s> \" that is what i like ; that is what a young man ought to be . </s>', '<s> whatever be his pursuits , his eagerness in them should know no moderation , and leave him no sense of fatigue . \" </s>', '<s> \" aye , aye , i see how it will be , \" said sir john , \" i see how it will be . </s>', '<s> you will be setting your cap at him now , and never think of poor brandon . \" </s>', '<s> \" that is an expression , sir john , \" said marianne , warmly , \" which i particularly dislike . </s>', \"<s> i abhor every common - place phrase by which wit is intended ; and ' setting one 's cap at a man , ' or ' making a conquest , ' are the most odious of all . </s>\", '<s> their tendency is gross and illiberal ; and if their construction could ever be deemed clever , time has long ago destroyed all its ingenuity . \" </s>', '<s> sir john did not much understand this reproof ; but he laughed as heartily as if he did , and then </s>', '<s> \" ay , you will make conquests enough , i dare say , one way or other . </s>', '<s> poor brandon ! </s>', '<s> he is quite smitten already , and he is very well worth setting your cap at , i can tell you , in spite of all this tumbling about and spraining of ankles . \" </s>', \"<s> marianne 's preserver , as margaret , with more elegance than precision , styled willoughby , called at the cottage early the next morning to make his personal enquiries . </s>\", \"<s> he was received by mrs. dashwood with more than politeness ; with a kindness which sir john 's account of him and her own gratitude prompted ; and every thing that passed during the visit tended to assure him of the sense , elegance , mutual affection , and domestic comfort of the family to whom accident had now introduced him . </s>\", '<s> of their personal charms he had not required a second interview to be convinced . </s>', '<s> miss dashwood had a delicate complexion , regular features , and a remarkably pretty figure . </s>', '<s> marianne was still handsomer . </s>', \"<s> her form , though not so correct as her sister 's , in having the advantage of height , was more striking ; and her face was so lovely , that when in the common ca nt of praise , she was called a beautiful girl , truth was less violently outraged than usually happens . </s>\", '<s> her skin was very brown , but , from its transparency , her complexion was uncommonly brilliant ; her features were all good ; her smile was sweet and attractive ; and in her eyes , which were very dark , there was a life , a spirit , an eagerness , which could hardily be seen without delight . </s>', '<s> from willoughby their expression was at first held back , by the embarrassment which the remembrance of his assistance created . </s>', '<s> but when this passed away , when her spirits became collected , when she saw that to the perfect good - breeding of the gentleman , he united frankness and vivacity , and above all , when she heard him declare , that of music and dancing he was passionately fond , she gave him such a look of approbation as secured the largest share of his discourse to herself for the rest of his stay . </s>', '<s> it was only necessary to mention any favourite amusement to engage her to talk . </s>', '<s> she could not be silent when such points were introduced , and she had neither shyness nor reserve in their discussion . </s>', '<s> they speedily discovered that their enjoyment of dancing and music was mutual , and that it arose from a general conformity of judgment in all that related to either . </s>', '<s> encouraged by this to a further examination of his opinions , she proceeded to question him on the subject of books ; her favourite authors were brought forward and dwelt upon with so rapturous a delight , that any young man of five and twenty must have been insensible indeed , not to become an immediate convert to the excellence of such works , however disregarded before . </s>', '<s> their taste was strikingly alike . </s>', '<s> the same books , the same passages were idolized by each ; or if any difference appeared , any objection arose , it lasted no longer than till the force of her arguments and the brightness of her eyes could be displayed . </s>', '<s> he acquiesced in all her decisions , caught all her enthusiasm ; and long before his visit concluded , they conversed with the familiarity of a long - established acquaintance . </s>', '<s> \" well , marianne , \" said elinor , as soon as he had left them , \" for _ one _ morning </s>', '<s> i think you have done pretty well . </s>', \"<s> you have already ascertained mr. willoughby 's opinion in almost every matter of importance . </s>\", '<s> you know what he thinks of cowper and scott ; you are certain of his estimating their beauties as he ought , and you have received every assurance of his admiring pope no more than is proper . </s>', '<s> but how is your acquaintance to be long supported , under such extraordinary despatch of every subject for discourse ? </s>', '<s> you will soon have exhausted each favourite topic . </s>', '<s> another meeting will suffice to explain his sentiments on picturesque beauty , and second marriages , and then you can have nothing farther to ask . \" </s>', '<s> \" elinor , \" cried marianne , \" is this fair ? </s>', '<s> is this just ? </s>', '<s> are my ideas so scanty ? </s>', '<s> but i see what you mean . </s>', '<s> i have been too much at my ease , too happy , too frank . </s>', '<s> i have erred against every common - place notion of decorum ; i have been open and sincere where i ought to have been reserved , spiritless , dull , and deceitful:--had i talked only of the weather and the roads , and had i spoken only once in ten minutes , this reproach would have been spared . \" </s>', '<s> \" my love , \" said her mother , \" you must not be offended with elinor -- she was only in jest . </s>', '<s> i should scold her myself , if she were capable of wishing to check the delight of your conversation with our new friend . </s>', '<s> marianne was softened in a moment . </s>', '<s> willoughby , on his side , gave every proof of his pleasure in their acquaintance , which an evident wish of improving it could offer . </s>', '<s> he came to them every day . </s>', \"<s> to enquire after marianne was at first his excuse ; but the encouragement of his reception , to which every day gave greater kindness , made such an excuse unnecessary before it had ceased to be possible , by marianne 's perfect recovery . </s>\", '<s> she was confined for some days to the house ; but never had any confinement been less irksome . </s>', '<s> willoughby was a young man of good abilities , quick imagination , lively spirits , and open , affectionate manners . </s>', \"<s> he was exactly formed to engage marianne 's heart , for with all this , he joined not only a captivating person , but a natural ardour of mind which was now roused and increased by the example of her own , and which recommended him to her affection beyond every thing else . </s>\", '<s> his society became gradually her most exquisite enjoyment . </s>', '<s> they read , they talked , they sang together ; his musical talents were considerable ; and he read with all the sensibility and spirit which edward had unfortunately wanted . </s>', \"<s> in mrs. dashwood 's estimation he was as faultless as in marianne 's ; and elinor saw nothing to censure in him but a propensity , in which he strongly resembled and peculiarly delighted her sister , of saying too much what he thought on every occasion , without attention to persons or circumstances . </s>\", '<s> in hastily forming and giving his opinion of other people , in sacrificing general politeness to the enjoyment of undivided attention where his heart was engaged , and in slighting too easily the forms of worldly propriety , he displayed a want of caution which elinor could not approve , in spite of all that he and marianne could say in its support . </s>', '<s> marianne began now to perceive that the desperation which had seized her at sixteen and a half , of ever seeing a man who could satisfy her ideas of perfection , had been rash and unjustifiable . </s>', '<s> willoughby was all that her fancy had delineated in that unhappy hour and in every brighter period , as capable of attaching her ; and his behaviour declared his wishes to be in that respect as earnest , as his abilities were strong . </s>', '<s> [ illustration : _ they sang together . _ ] </s>', '<s> her mother too , in whose mind not one speculative thought of their marriage had been raised , by his prospect of riches , was led before the end of a week to hope and expect it ; and secretly to congratulate herself on having gained two such sons - in - law as edward and willoughby . </s>', \"<s> colonel brandon 's partiality for marianne , which had so early been discovered by his friends , now first became perceptible to elinor , when it ceased to be noticed by them . </s>\", '<s> their attention and wit were drawn off to his more fortunate rival ; and the raillery which the other had incurred before any partiality arose , was removed when his feelings began really to call for the ridicule so justly annexed to sensibility . </s>', '<s> elinor was obliged , though unwillingly , to believe that the sentiments which mrs. jennings had assigned him for her own satisfaction , were now actually excited by her sister ; and that however a general resemblance of disposition between the parties might forward the affection of mr. willoughby , an equally striking opposition of character was no hindrance to the regard of colonel brandon . </s>', '<s> she saw it with concern ; for what could a silent man of five and thirty hope , when opposed to a very lively one of five and twenty ? </s>', '<s> and as she could not even wish him successful , she heartily wished him indifferent . </s>', '<s> she liked him -- in spite of his gravity and reserve , she beheld in him an object of interest . </s>', '<s> his manners , though serious , were mild ; and his reserve appeared rather the result of some oppression of spirits than of any natural gloominess of temper . </s>', '<s> sir john had dropped hints of past injuries and disappointments , which justified her belief of his being an unfortunate man , and she regarded him with respect and compassion . </s>', '<s> perhaps she pitied and esteemed him the more because he was slighted by willoughby and marianne , who , prejudiced against him for being neither lively nor young , seemed resolved to undervalue his merits . </s>', '<s> \" brandon is just the kind of man , \" said willoughby one day , when they were talking of him together , \" whom every body speaks well of , and nobody cares about ; whom all are delighted to see , and nobody remembers to talk to . \" </s>', '<s> \" that is exactly what i think of him , \" cried marianne . </s>', '<s> \" do not boast of it , however , \" said elinor , \" for it is injustice in both of you . </s>', '<s> he is highly esteemed by all the family at the park , and i never see him myself without taking pains to converse with him . \" </s>', '<s> \" that he is patronised by _ you _ , \" replied willoughby , \" is certainly in his favour ; but as for the esteem of the others , it is a reproach in itself . </s>', '<s> who would submit to the indignity of being approved by such a woman as lady middleton and mrs. jennings , that could command the indifference of any body else ? \" </s>', '<s> \" but perhaps the abuse of such people as yourself and marianne will make amends for the regard of lady middleton and her mother . </s>', '<s> if their praise is censure , your censure may be praise , for they are not more undiscerning , than you are prejudiced and unjust . \" </s>', '<s> in defence of your _ protege _ you can even be saucy . \" </s>', '<s> \" my _ protege _ , as you call him , is a sensible man ; and sense will always have attractions for me . </s>', '<s> yes , marianne , even in a man between thirty and forty . </s>', '<s> he has seen a great deal of the world ; has been abroad , has read , and has a thinking mind . </s>', '<s> i have found him capable of giving me much information on various subjects ; and he has always answered my inquiries with readiness of good - breeding and good nature . \" </s>', '<s> \" that is to say , \" cried marianne contemptuously , \" he has told you , that in the east indies the climate is hot , and the mosquitoes are troublesome . \" </s>', '<s> \" he _ would _ have told me so , i doubt not , had i made any such inquiries , but they happened to be points on which i had been previously informed . \" </s>', '<s> \" perhaps , \" said willoughby , \" his observations may have extended to the existence of nabobs , gold mohrs , and palanquins . \" </s>', '<s> \" i may venture to say that _ his _ observations have stretched much further than _ your _ candour . </s>', '<s> but why should you dislike him ? \" </s>', '<s> \" i do not dislike him . </s>', '<s> i consider him , on the contrary , as a very respectable man , who has every body \\'s good word , and nobody \\'s notice ; who , has more money than he can spend , more time than he knows how to employ , and two new coats every year . \" </s>', '<s> \" add to which , \" cried marianne , \" that he has neither genius , taste , nor spirit . </s>', '<s> that his understanding has no brilliancy , his feelings no ardour , and his voice no expression . \" </s>', '<s> \" you decide on his imperfections so much in the mass , \" replied elinor , \" and so much on the strength of your own imagination , that the commendation i am able to give of him is comparatively cold and insipid . </s>', '<s> i can only pronounce him to be a sensible man , well - bred , well - informed , of gentle address , and , i believe , possessing an amiable heart . \" </s>', '<s> \" miss dashwood , \" cried willoughby , \" you are now using me unkindly . </s>', '<s> you are endeavouring to disarm me by reason , and to convince me against my will . </s>', '<s> but it will not do . </s>', '<s> you shall find me as stubborn as you can be artful . </s>', '<s> i have three unanswerable reasons for disliking colonel brandon ; he threatened me with rain when i wanted it to be fine ; he has found fault with the hanging of my curricle , and i can not persuade him to buy my brown mare . </s>', '<s> if it will be any satisfaction to you , however , to be told , that i believe his character to be in other respects irreproachable , i am ready to confess it . </s>', '<s> and in return for an acknowledgment , which must give me some pain , you can not deny me the privilege of disliking him as much as ever . \" </s>', '<s> little had mrs. dashwood or her daughters imagined when they first came into devonshire , that so many engagements would arise to occupy their time as shortly presented themselves , or that they should have such frequent invitations and such constant visitors as to leave them little leisure for serious employment . </s>', '<s> yet such was the case . </s>', '<s> when marianne was recovered , the schemes of amusement at home and abroad , which sir john had been previously forming , were put into execution . </s>', '<s> the private balls at the park then began ; and parties on the water were made and accomplished as often as a showery october would allow . </s>', '<s> in every meeting of the kind willoughby was included ; and the ease and familiarity which naturally attended these parties were exactly calculated to give increasing intimacy to his acquaintance with the dashwoods , to afford him opportunity of witnessing the excellencies of marianne , of marking his animated admiration of her , and of receiving , in her behaviour to himself , the most pointed assurance of her affection . </s>', '<s> elinor could not be surprised at their attachment . </s>', '<s> she only wished that it were less openly shown ; and once or twice did venture to suggest the propriety of some self - command to marianne . </s>', '<s> but marianne abhorred all concealment where no real disgrace could attend unreserve ; and to aim at the restraint of sentiments which were not in themselves illaudable , appeared to her not merely an unnecessary effort , but a disgraceful subjection of reason to common - place and mistaken notions . </s>', '<s> willoughby thought the same ; and their behaviour at all times , was an illustration of their opinions . </s>', '<s> when he was present she had no eyes for any one else . </s>', '<s> every thing he did , was right . </s>', '<s> every thing he said , was clever . </s>', '<s> if their evenings at the park were concluded with cards , he cheated himself and all the rest of the party to get her a good hand . </s>', '<s> if dancing formed the amusement of the night , they were partners for half the time ; and when obliged to separate for a couple of dances , were careful to stand together and scarcely spoke a word to any body else . </s>', '<s> such conduct made them of course most exceedingly laughed at ; but ridicule could not shame , and seemed hardly to provoke them . </s>', '<s> mrs. dashwood entered into all their feelings with a warmth which left her no inclination for checking this excessive display of them . </s>', '<s> to her it was but the natural consequence of a strong affection in a young and ardent mind . </s>', '<s> this was the season of happiness to marianne . </s>', '<s> her heart was devoted to willoughby , and the fond attachment to norland , which she brought with her from sussex , was more likely to be softened than she had thought it possible before , by the charms which his society bestowed on her present home . </s>', \"<s> elinor 's happiness was not so great . </s>\", '<s> her heart was not so much at ease , nor her satisfaction in their amusements so pure . </s>', '<s> they afforded her no companion that could make amends for what she had left behind , nor that could teach her to think of norland with less regret than ever . </s>', '<s> neither lady middleton nor mrs. jennings could supply to her the conversation she missed ; although the latter was an everlasting talker , and from the first had regarded her with a kindness which ensured her a large share of her discourse . </s>', \"<s> she had already repeated her own history to elinor three or four times ; and had elinor 's memory been equal to her means of improvement , she might have known very early in their acquaintance all the particulars of mr. jennings 's last illness , and what he said to his wife a few minutes before he died . </s>\", '<s> lady middleton was more agreeable than her mother only in being more silent . </s>', '<s> elinor needed little observation to perceive that her reserve was a mere calmness of manner with which sense had nothing to do . </s>', '<s> towards her husband and mother she was the same as to them ; and intimacy was therefore neither to be looked for nor desired . </s>', '<s> she had nothing to say one day that she had not said the day before . </s>', '<s> her insipidity was invariable , for even her spirits were always the same ; and though she did not oppose the parties arranged by her husband , provided every thing were conducted in style and her two eldest children attended her , she never appeared to receive more enjoyment from them than she might have experienced in sitting at home ; and so little did her presence add to the pleasure of the others , by any share in their conversation , that they were sometimes only reminded of her being amongst them by her solicitude about her troublesome boys . </s>', '<s> in colonel brandon alone , of all her new acquaintance , did elinor find a person who could in any degree claim the respect of abilities , excite the interest of friendship , or give pleasure as a companion . </s>', '<s> willoughby was out of the question . </s>', \"<s> her admiration and regard , even her sisterly regard , was all his own ; but he was a lover ; his attentions were wholly marianne 's , and a far less agreeable man might have been more generally pleasing . </s>\", '<s> colonel brandon , unfortunately for himself , had no such encouragement to think only of marianne , and in conversing with elinor he found the greatest consolation for the indifference of her sister . </s>', \"<s> elinor 's compassion for him increased , as she had reason to suspect that the misery of disappointed love had already been known to him . </s>\", '<s> this suspicion was given by some words which accidentally dropped from him one evening at the park , when they were sitting down together by mutual consent , while the others were dancing . </s>', '<s> his eyes were fixed on marianne , and , </s>', '<s> after a silence of some minutes , he said , with a faint smile , \" your sister , i understand , does not approve of second attachments . \" </s>', '<s> \" no , \" replied elinor , \" her opinions are all romantic . \" </s>', '<s> \" or rather , as i believe , she considers them impossible to exist . \" </s>', '<s> \" i believe she does . </s>', '<s> but how she contrives it without reflecting on the character of her own father , who had himself two wives , i know not . </s>', '<s> a few years however will settle her opinions on the reasonable basis of common sense and observation ; and then they may be more easy to define and to justify than they now are , by any body but herself . \" </s>', '<s> \" this will probably be the case , \" he replied ; \" and yet there is something so amiable in the prejudices of a young mind , that one is sorry to see them give way to the reception of more general opinions . \" </s>', '<s> \" i can not agree with you there , \" said elinor . </s>', '<s> \" there are inconveniences attending such feelings as marianne \\'s , which all the charms of enthusiasm and ignorance of the world can not atone for . </s>', '<s> her systems have all the unfortunate tendency of setting propriety at nought ; and a better acquaintance with the world is what i look forward to as her greatest possible advantage . \" </s>', '<s> after a short pause he resumed the conversation by saying-- </s>', '<s> \" does your sister make no distinction in her objections against a second attachment ? or is it equally criminal in every body ? </s>', '<s> are those who have been disappointed in their first choice , whether from the inconstancy of its object , or the perverseness of circumstances , to be equally indifferent during the rest of their lives ? \" </s>', '<s> \" upon my word , i am not acquainted with the minutiae of her principles . </s>', '<s> i only know that i never yet heard her admit any instance of a second attachment \\'s being pardonable . \" </s>', '<s> \" this , \" said he , \" can not hold ; but a change , a total change of sentiments -- no , no , do not desire it ; for when the romantic refinements of a young mind are obliged to give way , how frequently are they succeeded by such opinions as are but too common , and too dangerous ! </s>', '<s> i speak from experience . </s>', '<s> i once knew a lady who in temper and mind greatly resembled your sister , who thought and judged like her , but who from an enforced change -- from a series of unfortunate circumstances-- \" here he stopped suddenly ; appeared to think that he had said too much , and by his countenance gave rise to conjectures , which might not otherwise have entered elinor \\'s head . </s>', '<s> the lady would probably have passed without suspicion , had he not convinced miss dashwood that what concerned her ought not to escape his lips . </s>', '<s> as it was , it required but a slight effort of fancy to connect his emotion with the tender recollection of past regard . </s>', '<s> elinor attempted no more . </s>', '<s> but marianne , in her place , would not have done so little . </s>', '<s> the whole story would have been speedily formed under her active imagination ; and every thing established in the most melancholy order of disastrous love . </s>', \"<s> as elinor and marianne were walking together the next morning the latter communicated a piece of news to her sister , which in spite of all that she knew before of marianne 's imprudence and want of thought , surprised her by its extravagant testimony of both . </s>\", '<s> marianne told her , with the greatest delight , that willoughby had given her a horse , one that he had bred himself on his estate in somersetshire , and which was exactly calculated to carry a woman . </s>', \"<s> without considering that it was not in her mother 's plan to keep any horse , that if she were to alter her resolution in favour of this gift , she must buy another for the servant , and keep a servant to ride it , and after all , build a stable to receive them , she had accepted the present without hesitation , and told her sister of it in raptures . </s>\", '<s> \" he intends to send his groom into somersetshire immediately for it , \" she added , \" and when it arrives we will ride every day . </s>', '<s> you shall share its use with me . </s>', '<s> imagine to yourself , my dear elinor , the delight of a gallop on some of these downs . \" </s>', '<s> most unwilling was she to awaken from such a dream of felicity to comprehend all the unhappy truths which attended the affair ; and for some time she refused to submit to them . </s>', '<s> as to an additional servant , the expense would be a trifle ; mamma she was sure would never object to it ; and any horse would do for _ him _ ; he might always get one at the park ; as to a stable , the merest shed would be sufficient . </s>', '<s> elinor then ventured to doubt the propriety of her receiving such a present from a man so little , or at least so lately known to her . </s>', '<s> this was too much . </s>', '<s> \" you are mistaken , elinor , \" said she warmly , \" in supposing i know very little of willoughby . </s>', '<s> i have not known him long indeed , but i am much better acquainted with him , than i am with any other creature in the world , except yourself and mama . </s>', '<s> it is not time or opportunity that is to determine intimacy ; it is disposition alone . </s>', '<s> seven years would be insufficient to make some people acquainted with each other , and seven days are more than enough for others . </s>', '<s> i should hold myself guilty of greater impropriety in accepting a horse from my brother , than from willoughby . </s>', '<s> of john i know very little , though we have lived together for years ; but of willoughby my judgment has long been formed . \" </s>', '<s> elinor thought it wisest to touch that point no more . </s>', \"<s> she knew her sister 's temper . </s>\", '<s> opposition on so tender a subject would only attach her the more to her own opinion . </s>', '<s> but by an appeal to her affection for her mother , by representing the inconveniences which that indulgent mother must draw on herself , if ( as would probably be the case ) she consented to this increase of establishment , marianne was shortly subdued ; and she promised not to tempt her mother to such imprudent kindness by mentioning the offer , and to tell willoughby when she saw him next , that it must be declined . </s>', '<s> she was faithful to her word ; and when willoughby called at the cottage , the same day , elinor heard her express her disappointment to him in a low voice , on being obliged to forego the acceptance of his present . </s>', '<s> the reasons for this alteration were at the same time related , and they were such as to make further entreaty on his side impossible . </s>', '<s> his concern however was very apparent ; and after expressing it with earnestness , he added , in the same low voice , \" </s>', '<s> but , marianne , the horse is still yours , though you can not use it now . </s>', '<s> i shall keep it only till you can claim it . </s>', '<s> when you leave barton to form your own establishment in a more lasting home , queen mab shall receive you . \" </s>', '<s> this was all overheard by miss dashwood ; and in the whole of the sentence , in his manner of pronouncing it , and in his addressing her sister by her christian name alone , she instantly saw an intimacy so decided , a meaning so direct , as marked a perfect agreement between them . </s>', '<s> from that moment she doubted not of their being engaged to each other ; and the belief of it created no other surprise than that she , or any of their friends , should be left by tempers so frank , to discover it by accident . </s>', '<s> margaret related something to her the next day , which placed this matter in a still clearer light . </s>', '<s> willoughby had spent the preceding evening with them , and margaret , by being left some time in the parlour with only him and marianne , had had opportunity for observations , which , with a most important face , she communicated to her eldest sister , when they were next by themselves . </s>', '<s> \" oh , elinor ! \" she cried , \" i have such a secret to tell you about marianne . </s>', '<s> i am sure she will be married to mr. willoughby very soon . \" </s>', '<s> \" you have said so </s>', '<s> , \" replied elinor , \" almost every day since they first met on high - church down ; and they had not known each other a week , i believe , before you were certain that marianne wore his picture round her neck ; but it turned out to be only the miniature of our great uncle . \" </s>', '<s> \" but indeed this is quite another thing . </s>', '<s> i am sure they will be married very soon , for he has got a lock of her hair . \" </s>', '<s> \" take care , margaret . </s>', '<s> it may be only the hair of some great uncle of _ his _ . \" </s>', '<s> \" but , indeed , elinor , it is marianne \\'s . </s>', '<s> i am almost sure it is , for i saw him cut it off . </s>', '<s> last night after tea , when you and mama went out of the room , they were whispering and talking together as fast as could be , and he seemed to be begging something of her , and presently he took up her scissors and cut off a long lock of her hair , for it was all tumbled down her back ; and he kissed it , and folded it up in a piece of white paper ; and put it into his pocket - book . \" </s>', '<s> for such particulars , stated on such authority , elinor could not withhold her credit ; nor was she disposed to it , for the circumstance was in perfect unison with what she had heard and seen herself . </s>', \"<s> margaret 's sagacity was not always displayed in a way so satisfactory to her sister . </s>\", '<s> when mrs. jennings attacked her one evening at the park , to give the name of the young man who was elinor \\'s particular favourite , which had been long a matter of great curiosity to her , margaret answered by looking at her sister , and saying , \" i must not tell , may i , elinor ? \" </s>', '<s> this of course made every body laugh ; and elinor tried to laugh too . </s>', '<s> but the effort was painful . </s>', '<s> she was convinced that margaret had fixed on a person whose name she could not bear with composure to become a standing joke with mrs. jennings . </s>', '<s> [ illustration : _ he cut off a long lock of her hair . _ ] </s>', '<s> marianne felt for her most sincerely ; but she did more harm than good to the cause , by turning very red and saying in an angry manner to margaret-- </s>', '<s> \" remember that whatever your conjectures may be , you have no right to repeat them . \" </s>', '<s> \" i never had any conjectures about it , \" replied margaret ; \" it was you who told me of it yourself . \" </s>', '<s> this increased the mirth of the company , and margaret was eagerly pressed to say something more . </s>', '<s> \" oh ! pray , miss margaret , let us know all about it , \" said mrs. jennings . </s>', '<s> what is the gentleman \\'s name ? \" </s>', '<s> \" i must not tell , ma\\'am . </s>', '<s> but i know very well what it is ; and i know where he is too . \" </s>', '<s> \" yes , yes , we can guess where he is ; at his own house at norland to be sure . </s>', '<s> he is the curate of the parish i dare say . \" </s>', '<s> \" no , _ that _ he is not . </s>', '<s> he is of no profession at all . \" </s>', '<s> \" margaret , \" said marianne with great warmth , \" you know that all this is an invention of your own , and that there is no such person in existence . \" </s>', '<s> well , then , he is lately dead , marianne , for i am sure there was such a man once , and his name begins with an f. \" </s>', '<s> most grateful did elinor feel to lady middleton for observing , at this moment , \" that it rained very hard , \" though she believed the interruption to proceed less from any attention to her , than from her ladyship \\'s great dislike of all such inelegant subjects of raillery as delighted her husband and mother . </s>', '<s> the idea however started by her , was immediately pursued by colonel brandon , who was on every occasion mindful of the feelings of others ; and much was said on the subject of rain by both of them . </s>', '<s> willoughby opened the piano - forte , and asked marianne to sit down to it ; and thus amidst the various endeavours of different people to quit the topic , it fell to the ground . </s>', '<s> but not so easily did elinor recover from the alarm into which it had thrown her . </s>', '<s> a party was formed this evening for going on the following day to see a very fine place about twelve miles from barton , belonging to a brother - in - law of colonel brandon , without whose interest it could not be seen , as the proprietor , who was then abroad , had left strict orders on that head . </s>', '<s> the grounds were declared to be highly beautiful , and sir john , who was particularly warm in their praise , might be allowed to be a tolerable judge , for he had formed parties to visit them , at least , twice every summer for the last ten years . </s>', \"<s> they contained a noble piece of water -- a sail on which was to a form a great part of the morning 's amusement ; cold provisions were to be taken , open carriages only to be employed , and every thing conducted in the usual style of a complete party of pleasure . </s>\", '<s> to some few of the company it appeared rather a bold undertaking , considering the time of year , and that it had rained every day for the last fortnight ; and mrs. dashwood , who had already a cold , was persuaded by elinor to stay at home . </s>', '<s> their intended excursion to whitwell turned out very different from what elinor had expected . </s>', '<s> she was prepared to be wet through , fatigued , and frightened ; but the event was still more unfortunate , for they did not go at all . </s>', \"<s> by ten o'clock the whole party was assembled at the park , where they were to breakfast . </s>\", '<s> the morning was rather favourable , though it had rained all night , as the clouds were then dispersing across the sky , and the sun frequently appeared . </s>', '<s> they were all in high spirits and good humour , eager to be happy , and determined to submit to the greatest inconveniences and hardships rather than be otherwise . </s>', '<s> while they were at breakfast the letters were brought in . </s>', '<s> among the rest there was one for colonel brandon:--he took it , looked at the direction , changed colour , and immediately left the room . </s>', '<s> \" what is the matter with brandon ? \" said sir john . </s>', '<s> nobody could tell . </s>', '<s> \" i hope he has had no bad news , \" said lady middleton . </s>', '<s> \" it must be something extraordinary that could make colonel brandon leave my breakfast table so suddenly . \" </s>', '<s> in about five minutes he returned . </s>', '<s> \" no bad news , colonel , i hope ; \" said mrs. jennings , as soon as he entered the room . </s>', '<s> \" none at all , ma\\'am , i thank you . \" </s>', '<s> \" was it from avignon ? </s>', '<s> i hope it is not to say that your sister is worse . \" </s>', '<s> \" no , ma\\'am . </s>', '<s> it came from town , and is merely a letter of business . \" </s>', '<s> \" but how came the hand to discompose you so much , if it was only a letter of business ? come , come , this wo n\\'t do , colonel ; so let us hear the truth of it . \" </s>', '<s> \" my dear madam , \" said lady middleton , \" recollect what you are saying . \" </s>', '<s> \" perhaps it is to tell you that your cousin fanny is married ? \" said mrs. jennings , without attending to her daughter \\'s reproof . </s>', '<s> \" no , indeed , it is not . \" </s>', '<s> \" well , then , i know who it is from , colonel . </s>', '<s> and i hope she is well . \" </s>', '<s> \" whom do you mean , ma\\'am ? \" said he , colouring a little . </s>', '<s> \" oh ! you know who i mean . \" </s>', '<s> \" i am particularly sorry , ma\\'am , \" said he , addressing lady middleton , \" that i should receive this letter today , for it is on business which requires my immediate attendance in town . \" </s>', '<s> \" in town ! \" cried mrs. jennings . </s>', '<s> \" what can you have to do in town at this time of year ? \" </s>', '<s> my own loss is great , \" he continued , \" in being obliged to leave so agreeable a party ; but i am the more concerned , as i fear my presence is necessary to gain your admittance at whitwell . \" </s>', '<s> what a blow upon them all was this ! </s>', '<s> \" but if you write a note to the housekeeper , mr. brandon , \" said marianne , eagerly , \" will it not be sufficient ? \" </s>', '<s> he shook his head . </s>', '<s> \" we must go , \" said sir john . </s>', '<s> \" it shall not be put off when we are so near it . </s>', '<s> you can not go to town till tomorrow , brandon , that is all . \" </s>', '<s> \" i wish it could be so easily settled . </s>', '<s> but it is not in my power to delay my journey for one day ! \" </s>', '<s> \" if you would but let us know what your business is , \" said mrs. jennings , \" we might see whether it could be put off or not . \" </s>', '<s> \" you would not be six hours later , \" said willoughby , \" if you were to defer your journey till our return . \" </s>', '<s> i can not afford to lose _ one _ hour . \" </s>', '<s> elinor then heard willoughby say , in a low voice to marianne , \" there are some people who can not bear a party of pleasure . </s>', '<s> brandon is one of them . </s>', '<s> he was afraid of catching cold i dare say , and invented this trick for getting out of it . </s>', '<s> i would lay fifty guineas the letter was of his own writing . \" </s>', '<s> \" i have no doubt of it , \" replied marianne . </s>', '<s> \" there is no persuading you to change your mind , brandon , i know of old , \" said sir john , \" when once you are determined on anything . </s>', '<s> but , however , i hope you will think better of it . </s>', '<s> consider , here are the two miss careys come over from newton , the three miss dashwoods walked up from the cottage , and mr. willoughby got up two hours before his usual time , on purpose to go to whitwell . \" </s>', '<s> colonel brandon again repeated his sorrow at being the cause of disappointing the party ; but at the same time declared it to be unavoidable . </s>', '<s> well , then , when will you come back again ? \" </s>', '<s> \" i hope we shall see you at barton , \" added her ladyship , \" as soon as you can conveniently leave town ; and we must put off the party to whitwell till you return . \" </s>', '<s> \" you are very obliging . </s>', '<s> but it is so uncertain , when i may have it in my power to return , that i dare not engage for it at all . \" </s>', '<s> \" oh ! he must and shall come back , \" cried sir john . </s>', '<s> \" if he is not here by the end of the week , i shall go after him . \" </s>', '<s> \" ay , so do , sir john , \" cried mrs. jennings , \" and then perhaps you may find out what his business is . \" </s>', '<s> \" i do not want to pry into other men \\'s concerns . </s>', '<s> i suppose it is something he is ashamed of . \" </s>', \"<s> colonel brandon 's horses were announced . </s>\", '<s> \" you do not go to town on horseback , do you ? \" added sir john . </s>', '<s> \" no . only to honiton . </s>', '<s> i shall then go post . \" </s>', '<s> \" well , as you are resolved to go , i wish you a good journey . </s>', '<s> but you had better change your mind . \" </s>', '<s> i assure you it is not in my power . \" </s>', '<s> he then took leave of the whole party . </s>', '<s> \" is there no chance of my seeing you and your sisters in town this winter , miss dashwood ? \" </s>', '<s> i am afraid , none at all . \" </s>', '<s> \" then i must bid you farewell for a longer time than i should wish to do . \" </s>', '<s> to marianne , he merely bowed and said nothing . </s>', '<s> \" come colonel , \" said mrs. jennings , \" before you go , do let us know what you are going about . \" </s>', '<s> he wished her a good morning , and , attended by sir john , left the room . </s>', '<s> the complaints and lamentations which politeness had hitherto restrained , now burst forth universally ; and they all agreed again and again how provoking it was to be so disappointed . </s>', '<s> \" i can guess what his business is , however , \" said mrs. jennings exultingly . </s>', '<s> \" can you , ma\\'am ? \" said almost every body . </s>', '<s> \" yes ; it is about miss williams , i am sure . \" </s>', '<s> \" and who is miss williams ? \" asked marianne . </s>', '<s> \" what ! do not you know who miss williams is ? </s>', '<s> i am sure you must have heard of her before . </s>', \"<s> she is a relation of the colonel 's , my dear ; a very near relation . </s>\", '<s> we will not say how near , for fear of shocking the young ladies . \" </s>', '<s> then , lowering her voice a little , she said to elinor , \" she is his natural daughter . \" </s>', '<s> \" indeed ! \" </s>', '<s> \" oh , yes ; and as like him as she can stare . </s>', '<s> i dare say the colonel will leave her all his fortune . \" </s>', '<s> when sir john returned , he joined most heartily in the general regret on so unfortunate an event ; concluding however by observing , that as they were all got together , they must do something by way of being happy ; and after some consultation it was agreed , that although happiness could only be enjoyed at whitwell , they might procure a tolerable composure of mind by driving about the country . </s>', \"<s> the carriages were then ordered ; willoughby 's was first , and marianne never looked happier than when she got into it . </s>\", '<s> he drove through the park very fast , and they were soon out of sight ; and nothing more of them was seen till their return , which did not happen till after the return of all the rest . </s>', '<s> they both seemed delighted with their drive ; but said only in general terms that they had kept in the lanes , while the others went on the downs . </s>', '<s> it was settled that there should be a dance in the evening , and that every body should be extremely merry all day long . </s>', '<s> some more of the careys came to dinner , and they had the pleasure of sitting down nearly twenty to table , which sir john observed with great contentment . </s>', '<s> willoughby took his usual place between the two elder miss dashwoods . </s>', '<s> mrs. jennings sat on elinor \\'s right hand ; and they had not been long seated , before she leant behind her and willoughby , and said to marianne , loud enough for them both to hear , \" i have found you out in spite of all your tricks . </s>', '<s> i know where you spent the morning . \" </s>', '<s> marianne coloured , and replied very hastily , \" where , pray ? \" </s>', '<s> \" did not you know , \" said willoughby , \" that we had been out in my curricle ? \" </s>', '<s> \" yes , yes , mr. impudence , i know that very well , and i was determined to find out _ where _ you had been to . </s>', '<s> i hope you like your house , miss marianne . </s>', '<s> it is a very large one , i know ; and when i come to see you , i hope you will have new - furnished it , for it wanted it very much when i was there six years ago . \" </s>', '<s> marianne turned away in great confusion . </s>', \"<s> mrs. jennings laughed heartily ; and elinor found that in her resolution to know where they had been , she had actually made her own woman enquire of mr. willoughby 's groom ; and that she had by that method been informed that they had gone to allenham , and spent a considerable time there in walking about the garden and going all over the house . </s>\", '<s> elinor could hardly believe this to be true , as it seemed very unlikely that willoughby should propose , or marianne consent , to enter the house while mrs. smith was in it , with whom marianne had not the smallest acquaintance . </s>', '<s> as soon as they left the dining - room , elinor enquired of her about it ; and great was her surprise when she found that every circumstance related by mrs. jennings was perfectly true . </s>', '<s> marianne was quite angry with her for doubting it . </s>', '<s> \" why should you imagine , elinor , that we did not go there , or that we did not see the house ? </s>', '<s> is not it what you have often wished to do yourself ? \" </s>', '<s> yes , marianne , but i would not go while mrs. smith was there , and with no other companion than mr. willoughby . \" </s>', '<s> [ illustration : \" _ i have found you out in spite of all your tricks . _ \" ] </s>', '<s> \" mr. willoughby however is the only person who can have a right to show that house ; and as he went in an open carriage , it was impossible to have any other companion . </s>', '<s> i never spent a pleasanter morning in my life . \" </s>', '<s> \" i am afraid , \" replied elinor , \" that the pleasantness of an employment does not always evince its propriety . \" </s>', '<s> \" on the contrary , nothing can be a stronger proof of it , elinor ; for if there had been any real impropriety in what i did , i should have been sensible of it at the time , for we always know when we are acting wrong , and with such a conviction i could have had no pleasure . \" </s>', '<s> \" but , my dear marianne , as it has already exposed you to some very impertinent remarks , do you not now begin to doubt the discretion of your own conduct ? \" </s>', '<s> \" if the impertinent remarks of mrs. jennings are to be the proof of impropriety in conduct , we are all offending every moment of our lives . </s>', '<s> i value not her censure any more than i should do her commendation . </s>', \"<s> i am not sensible of having done anything wrong in walking over mrs. smith 's grounds , or in seeing her house . </s>\", '<s> they will one day be mr. willoughby \\'s , and-- \" </s>', '<s> if they were one day to be your own , marianne , you would not be justified in what you have done . \" </s>', '<s> she blushed at this hint ; but it was even visibly gratifying to her ; and after a ten minutes \\' interval of earnest thought , she came to her sister again , and said with great good humour , \" perhaps , elinor , it _ was _ rather ill - judged in me to go to allenham ; but mr. willoughby wanted particularly to show me the place ; and it is a charming house , i assure you . </s>', '<s> there is one remarkably pretty sitting room up stairs ; of a nice comfortable size for constant use , and with modern furniture it would be delightful . </s>', '<s> it is a corner room , and has windows on two sides . </s>', '<s> on one side you look across the bowling - green , behind the house , to a beautiful hanging wood , and on the other you have a view of the church and village , and , beyond them , of those fine bold hills that we have so often admired . </s>', '<s> i did not see it to advantage , for nothing could be more forlorn than the furniture ; but if it were newly fitted up -- a couple of hundred pounds , willoughby says , would make it one of the pleasantest summer - rooms in england . \" </s>', '<s> could elinor have listened to her without interruption from the others , she would have described every room in the house with equal delight . </s>']\n"
