General Lee knows that a letter has been  prepared by the Southern government .                             A letter which offers peace .                             It is to be placed on the desk  of Abraham Lincoln, President of the U . S . . .                             the day after Lee has destroyed  the Army of the Potomac . . .                             somewhere north of Washington .                             Federal cavalry . Two brigades .                             - Howdy, friend . Where you headed ?  - General Longstreet . I must see him .                             Is that a fact ?                             I know General Lee\\'s headquarters  are up here a little ways .                             Wherever he is, Longstreet is nearby .                             - Take me that way . This is urgent .  - Let me put it to you like this, stranger .                             You\\'re not in a uniform  and you\\'re coming through my picket line .                             I\\'ll take you up there,  but if nobody there knows you . . .                             I guess, unfortunately,  you\\'ll have to be hanged .                             Sir . General, sir .                             I\\'m sorry, excuse me, sir,  but Harrison is back .                             - Harrison ?  - Yes, sir .                             The scout, Harrison, sir .                             I knew you\\'d want to know that  as soon as possible .                             He\\'s right outside here, sir .                             Your servant, General .                             Didn\\'t expect to see me, did you ?                             I paid you in gold three weeks ago .  What do you got ?                             I don\\'t suppose you got  another one of those .                             That good southern tobacco .                             What do you got ?                             I got the position of the Yankee army .  They\\'re only a few miles down the road .                             The whole Yankee army coming this way .  Seven corps .                             A few miles ?                             Yes . Two brigades of Yankee cavalry  down that road about . . .                             two, four hours away .                             Behind that there\\'s seven corps .                             I put it all on a map, if you\\'d like to see it .  About       men .                             All seven corps .                             You didn\\'t know any of that, General ?                             You didn\\'t know they were on the move .                             You wouldn\\'t be spread so thin  if you\\'d known .                             How do you know we\\'re spread out ?                             Listen, General . I\\'m good at this business .                             Sir, I beg your pardon,  but if this man\\'s story is true . . .                             why haven\\'t we heard about it ?                             General Stuart\\'s cavalry is out there .  He would have reported .                             - What do you know about Jeb Stuart ?  - He\\'s out there all right .                             He\\'s riding up north somewhere  getting his name in the papers .                             He hasn\\'t caused anything but a little fuss .                             If the federal army was moving that fast,  as close as you say . . .                             - I have to believe General Stuart . . .  - Now, look here .                             I came within an angry mule\\'s kick  of the whole Yankee cavalry .                             And all the way through a picket line .                             Hazardous, too .                             I don\\'t know what Jeb Stuart\\'s doing .                             I don\\'t care . I do my job .                             Yankee cavalry\\'s down the road,  thick as fleas . . .                             not two hours hard ride  from this here now spot .                             And that, by God, is the Lord\\'s truth !                             - Major Sorrel .  - Yes, sir .                             Will you go to General Lee\\'s headquarters  and notify him about this ?                             Yes, sir .                             - Captain Goree .  - Yes, sir .                             Get this man a tent .                             And a cigar .                             Sir .                             He says the lead element is here  with the Third Corps . . .                             the Sixth right behind . . .                             supported by a column of federal cavalry .                             Seven corps all together .                             The First and Eleventh  are above Taneytown .                             And there\\'s more cavalry two hours east .                             There may be as many  as        altogether .                             Do you believe the man, this Mr . Harrison ?                             No choice . You remember him, sir,  the actor from Mississippi ?                             An actor ?  We move on the word of an actor ?                             Can\\'t afford not to .                             There would be some word  from General Stuart .                             General Stuart would not leave us blind .                             One other thing . Hooker\\'s been replaced .                             George Meade\\'s the new commander .  Harrison read it in the Yankee papers .                             George Meade, Pennsylvania man .                             Meade would be cautious, I think .                             Take him some time to get organized .                             Perhaps we should move more swiftly .                             There may be an opportunity here .                             Yes, sir .                             No reason to delay .                             I think we should concentrate here .                             All the roads converge  just east of this gap .                             - This junction will be very necessary .  - Yes, sir .                             I left my spectacles over there .  What is the name of this town ?                              Gettysburg .                              Very well .                              Message for Colonel Chamberlain .                              Colonel, darling . Rise up, me bucko .                              I\\'m sorry, darling,  but we got a bit of a problem here .                              Would you like to hear about it ?                              Would you wake up, sir ?                              We got a whole company coming, sir .                              This way . I\\'ll give you time to wake up,  but we\\'ve got quite a problem .                              Altogether,     men are coming .  We\\'re to be having them as guests .                              What ?                              Should be here any minute .                              - Who ?  - Mutineers .                              Mutineers, Colonel, me lad .                                  men from the old Second Maine  which has been disbanded .                                  mutineers ?                              Yes, sir .                              You see, what happened was  the enlistment papers . . .                              on the old Second Maine run out .                              They were sent home,  all except these     fellows . . .                              who foolishly signed three-year papers .                              Three years, that is .                              So these poor fellows  got one more year to serve .                              Only they thought they were signing  to fight only with the Second Maine . . .                              and the Second Maine only .                              So they . . .                              quit .                              They resigned, you see .     men .                              - Colonel, are you all right ?  - Yeah .                              The point is,  these Maine fellows won\\'t fight no more .                              Nobody can send them home  and nobody knows what to do with them .                              Until they thought of us . . .                              being as we are the only other  Maine regiment in the Fifth Corps .                              So they\\'ve been assigned to us .                              Yes, sir .                              I have a message here  from the new commanding general .                              George Meade, sir .                              That\\'s right .                              Our very own general  of our very own corps . . .                              has been promoted  to command of the whole army .                              The latest, if you keep track of them  as they go by .                              The message says they\\'ll be arriving  this morning and they are to join us .                              \"And if they refuse to follow orders,  please feel free to shoot them .\"                              - To shoot them ?  - Yes, sir .                              These Maine men ?                              \"You are hereby authorized to shoot  any man who refuses to do his duty .\"                              Are these all Maine men ?                              Yes, sir . And fine big fellows they are, too .                              Mutiny . I thought that was  a word for the Navy .                              We\\'ll move at sunrise .                              It\\'s a good time of the day .                              I always do enjoy this time,  just before the dawn .                              When all this is over,  I shall miss it very much .                              Sir ?                              I didn\\'t mean the fighting .                              It\\'s all in God\\'s hands now .                              Good day, sir .                              Good day to you .                              General, sir .                              Should I wake them up, sir ? Should I  get them waked up and get going ?                              No, Moxley .                              Let the boys sleep a little longer .  They\\'ll need it .                              Yes, sir .                              Prisoners, mark file, left !                              How many men do we have now  in the   th Maine ?                              Somewhere around     sir,  counting the officers .                              How the heck are we supposed  to take care of     men ?                              Colonel, it\\'s going to be a hot day today .                              Seeing as you already been down  with the heat, will you ride the horse . . .                              that the good Lord provided,  instead of marching in the dirty dust ?                              You walked .                              Darling, I\\'ve been in the infantry  since you was in books .                              After the first few thousand miles,  a man gets limber with his feet .                              Morning, Lawrence .                              How are you ?

We\\'ll set you up in those trees .  Sergeant Tozier, see to it .                              Yes, sir .                              You boys go eat, then I\\'ll come over  and hear what you have to say .                              Colonel, we\\'ve got grievances .                              The men elected me to talk for them .                              All right . You come along with me .                              The rest of you boys go eat .  We\\'re going to get moving in a little bit .                              All right, men, on your feet .                              - Gosh, Lawrence .  - Smile . Don\\'t call me Lawrence .                              - Are they moving ?  - Yes, sir .                              Forward, march .                              What\\'s your name ?                              I don\\'t feel too kindly, Colonel .                              Yes, well, I\\'m usually not this informal .                              I just took command  of this regiment a few days ago .                              Somebody ought to welcome you  to my . . . our outfit .                              They tell me they\\'re holding you fellows  because you signed three-year papers .                              I\\'m sorry . Would you like some coffee ?                              Are you sure ?                              - Go ahead . Sit down, Mister . . .  - Bucklin .                              Joseph Bucklin .                              Listen, Colonel .  I\\'ve been in    different engagements .                              How many have you been in ?                              Not that many .                              It ain\\'t the papers .                              I\\'ve done my share . We all have .                              They are damn good men .  Shouldn\\'t be used this way .                              Look here .                              It went clean through .                              We got a courier coming .                              Listen, Colonel . I\\'m tired .                              You know what I mean ? I\\'m tired .                              I\\'ve had all this army, all these officers . . .  This damn Hooker, this damn idiot Meade .                              All of them . The whole bloody, lousy mess  of sick-brained, potbellied scareheads .                              They ain\\'t fit to lead a johnny detail .                              They ain\\'t fit to pour pee out of a boot  with instructions written under the heel .                              I\\'m tired .                              We\\'re good men  and we had our own good flag .                              These damn idiots used us  like we were cows or dogs or worse .                              We aren\\'t gonna win this war .                              We can\\'t win with these  lame-brained bastards from West Point .                              These damn gentlemen ! These officers !                              The courier, sir .                              Don\\'t go away .                              Colonel Chamberlain, sir .                              Colonel Vincent wishes to inform you  the Fifth Corps is moving out .                              You and the   th Maine Regiment  are instructed to lead .                                th Maine\\'s assigned first position in line .  Send out advanced guards and flankers .                              - Flankers ?  - Yes, flankers .                              Right, yes .  My compliments to the Colonel .                              Captain Clark, you heard him .  Get the regiment up .                              Sound the assembly . Strike the tents .                              You better get something to eat .  Looks like you could use it .                              Tell your men I\\'m coming .                              The boys from the Second Maine  are being fed, Lawrence .                              Don\\'t call me Lawrence .                              Damn it, Lawrence . I\\'m your brother .                              Be careful about the name business  in front of the men .                              Because we\\'re brothers,  it looks like favoritism .                              General Meade got his own son  as his aide-de-camp .                              That\\'s different . Generals can do anything .                              Nothing quite so much like God on earth  as a general on battlefield .                              What are you going to do with them ?  Colonel, sir .                              You can\\'t shoot them .  You never go back to Maine if you do .                              I know that .                              I wonder if they do .                              Colonel, sir . You know who this man is ?                              Dan Burns, from Orono .  I know his daddy, the preacher .                              Best cusser I ever heard .                              Knows more fine swear words  than any man in Maine .                              You men gather around .                              I\\'ve been talking with Private Bucklin .  He\\'s told me about your problem .                              There\\'s nothing I can do today .                              We\\'re moving out in a few minutes .  We\\'ll be moving all day .                              I\\'ve been ordered  to take you men with me .                              I\\'m told that . . .                              if you don\\'t come, I can shoot you .                              Well, you know I won\\'t do that .                              Maybe somebody else will, but I won\\'t .                              So, that\\'s that .                              Here\\'s the situation .                              The whole reb army is up that road  a ways waiting for us .                              This is no time for an argument .                              I tell you, we could surely use you fellows .                              We\\'re now well below half strength .                              Whether you fight or not, that\\'s up to you .                              Whether you come along is . . .  Well, you\\'re coming .                              You know who we are, why we\\'re here .                              If you fight alongside us,  there\\'s a few things you must know .                              This regiment was formed  last summer in Maine .                              There were      of us then .                              There are less than     of us now .                              All of us volunteered to fight  for the Union, just as you did .                              Some came mainly because  we were bored at home .                              Thought this looked like it might be fun .                              Some came because  we were ashamed not to .                              Many of us came  because it was the right thing to do .                              And all of us have seen men die .                              This is a different kind of army .                              If you look back through history,  you\\'ll see men fighting for pay . . .                              for women, for some other kind of loot .                              They fight for land, power .                              Because a king leads them,  or just because they like killing .                              We are here for something new .                              This has not happened much  in the history of the world .                              We are an army out to set other men free .                              America should be free ground .                              All of it .                              Not divided by a line  between slave state and free .                              All the way from here to the Pacific Ocean .                              No man has to bow .                              No man born to royalty .                              Here we judge you by what you do,  not by who your father was .                              Here you can be something .                              Here is the place to build a home .                              But it\\'s not the land .                              There\\'s always more land .                              It\\'s the idea that we all have value .                              You and me .                              What we\\'re fighting for, in the end . . .                              we\\'re fighting for each other .                              Sorry .                              I didn\\'t mean to preach .                              You go ahead .                              You talk for a while .                              If you choose to join us and want  your muskets back, you can have them .                              Nothing more will be said  by anybody, anywhere .                              If you choose not to join us,  you can come along under guard .                              When this is over, I\\'ll do what I can . . .                              to see you get a fair treatment,  but for now, we\\'re moving out .                              Gentlemen .                              I think if we lose this fight . . .                              we lose the war .                              So, if you choose to join us,  I\\'ll be personally very grateful .                              Colonel, it\\'s a fine morning .                              - Captain Spear, are we ready ?  - Sir, that we are .                              Then let\\'s move out .                                th Maine !                              Forward !                              March !                              That\\'s infantry, all right .                              At least a whole brigade .                              Any sign of cavalry ?                              Not a lick, sir .                              That\\'s strange .                              Infantry moving alone  in enemy country, blind .                              Very strange, sir .                              What do you make of that ?                              He\\'s headed this way .                              Sir ?                              Lee\\'s turned . That\\'s the main body .                              You think so ?                              - I thought they were going to Harrisburg .  - He was .                              That\\'s too many troops  to be a raiding party .                              There\\'s power behind it .                              Sir, if you want to fight here,  this is such lovely ground .                              It\\'s the best damn ground I\\'ve seen all day .                              It is that .                              We\\'ll move both brigades into town .                              That\\'ll make the good citizens happy .                              Let\\'s go down and have a look .                              - Soldier, your shirt needs mending .  - I thought the war was in Virginia .                              What division are you boys with ?                              Colonel, do you mind ?                              A good officer doesn\\'t ride all day .  I\\'ve been sitting too long anyway .                              What do you think ?                              - What do you think ?  - About what ?                              About the Second Maine boys, what else ?                              Are any of them going to join us ?                              Would you believe it ? All but six !                              What ?                              I counted by actual vote .      voted to pick up the rifle .                              - Well, I\\'ll be .  - You did good, brother, real good !                              Good . See to it they march together .                              Yes . Glazier\\'s got the hardheads in tow .  There are six .                              Get the names .  Put them in different companies .                              I want them spread out,  not bunched together .                              - I\\'ll see about their muskets .  - Colonel, sir .                              You know what\\'s happening here  in the morning ?                              Sir ?                              The whole damn rebel army  is gonna be here .                              They\\'ll move through this town,  occupy the hills on the other side .                              When our people arrive, Lee\\'ll have  high ground . There\\'ll be the devil to pay .                              The high ground !                              Meade will come in slowly, cautiously,  new to command .                              They\\'ll be on his back from Washington .                              Wires hot with messages . Attack ! Attack !                              So he will set up a ring around these hills .                              And when Lee\\'s army is nicely entrenched  behind fat rocks on the high ground . . .                              Meade will finally attack,  if he can coordinate the army .                              Straight up the hillside, out in the open . . .                              in that gorgeous field of fire .                              We will charge valiantly  and be butchered valiantly .                              And afterward, men in tall hats and  gold watch fobs will thump their chest . . .                              and say what a brave charge it was .                              Devin, I\\'ve led a soldier\\'s life . . .                              and I\\'ve never seen anything  as brutally clear as this .                              It\\'s as if I can actually see the blue troops  in one long bloody moment . . .                              going up the long slope to the stony top . . .                              as if it were already done . . .                              and already a memory .                              An odd, set . . .                              stony quality to it .                              As if tomorrow has already happened  and there\\'s nothing you can do about it .                              The way you sometimes feel  before an ill-considered attack . . .                              knowing it will fail . . .                              but you cannot stop it .                              You must even take part and help it fail .                              We have      men .                              They\\'ll be coming in force .                              There could be        coming down that road in the morning .                              If we hold this ridge for a couple of hours,  we can keep them away .                              We can block that road  until our main body gets here .                              We can deprive the enemy  of the high ground !                              The boys are ready for a brawl .  No doubt of that .                              We\\'ll force the reb to deploy .                              That\\'s a narrow road  they\\'ll be coming down .                              If we stack them up, it will take them a  while to get on track to get into position .                              Is Calef\\'s battery up yet ?                              His six guns are deploying now .                              How far back is Reynolds  with the main force ?                              About    miles, sir . Not much more .                              Sir, you were right .                              My scouts report the rebel army  is coming this way for sure .                              They\\'re all concentrating in this direction .                              We\\'ll hold here in the morning .                              Long enough for Reynolds  and the infantry to arrive .                              If we hang on to the high ground,  we have a chance . . .                              to win this fight that\\'s coming .                              - Understood ?  - Yes, sir .                              Post the cannon along this road,  the Chambersburg Pike .                              The rebels will hit us at dawn .  I think we can hold them at least   hours .                              Hell, General,  we can hold them all the livelong day .                              He\\'s right, sir .                              At Thoroughfare Gap,  you held against Longstreet .                              - You held for six hours .  - They never came . We held for nothing .                              The rebs will hit us just about first light .                              Keep a clear eye .                              Have the pickets give us a good warning .                              All right, gentlemen .                              Let\\'s get posted .                              General Reynolds,  my troops are deployed on good ground . . .                              west of Gettysburg  on the Chambersburg Pike .                              I\\'ve sent reconnaissance parties  in every direction . . .                              from which the enemy  might be approaching .                              I\\'m satisfied A .P . Hill\\'s corps  is massed just west of here . . .                              back of Cashtown .                              The enemy\\'s pickets  are within four miles of my position .                              Rumor says Ewell\\'s coming  over the mountains from Carlisle .                              If true, two Confederate corps  will converge upon us in the morning .                              One from the west and one from the north .                              Do you want me to hold  this position if attacked ?                              Confirmation requested .                              J .N .O . Buford .                              \"Bow down thy heaven, O Lord .                              \"Come down and touch the mountains  and they shall smoke .                              \"Blessed be the Lord, my strength,  which teaches my fingers to fight . . .                              \"and my hands to war . Amen .\"                              Good morning, Lucy .                              Traveler, good morning to you, sir .                              Good morning, sir .                              Good morning, Major Taylor .                              - Will the General have some breakfast ?  - No, thank you .                              We have flapjacks in small mountains .                              Fresh butter, bacon, wagons of ham,  apple butter, ripe cherries .                              You really ought to pitch in, sir .                              Courtesy of our host,  the great Commonwealth of Pennsylvania .                              Good morning, sir .                              General Longstreet, good morning .                              Federal forces are concentrating .                              Yes, and I\\'ve confirmed  some of your man Harrison\\'s information .                              Their new commander  is definitely George Meade .                              I have reports of Union cavalry  in Gettysburg .                              Cavalry ?                              General Hill reports only militia .                              He did ?                              Well, it\\'s cavalry .                              Where there\\'s cavalry,  infantry will be close behind .                              Meade\\'s closing fast .                              It could be he\\'s thinking  of swinging round behind us .                              Behind, in front: Direction does not matter .  We\\'ll fight him wherever he is .                              Probably got old Abe Lincoln on his back  frantic to throw us out of Pennsylvania .                              We may have an opportunity here .                              I agree .                              Our objective was to get their army  out of Virginia and into the open .                              Now they are in the open .                              General Meade has been forcing  the march .                              The weather has been unusually hot .                              He will probably arrive here worn out  and weary, piece by piece .                              If we concentrate,  we can hit him as he comes up .                              If we can take out a few of his corps,  we can even the odds .                              But we must strike hard  and we must strike quickly .                              What artillery is that, Major ?                              I don\\'t know, sir .                              General Heth is in front .                              - My instructions were clear ?  - Yes, sir . To all commanders .                              Avoid contact with the enemy  until the army\\'s up and concentrated .                              And General Heth ?                              He has instructions  not to force major action .                              I told him this morning .                              We should move closer to the front .  Send for General Heth .                              - I must know what is going on .  - Yes, sir .                              General . . .                              in the fight that is coming,  I want you to stay back from the main line .                              This army has lost too many  of its veteran commanders . . .                              and you, sir, have a very bad habit  of moving too far forward .                              Can\\'t lead from behind .                              May I say it plainly, sir .                              I cannot afford to lose you .                              Now, General, let\\'s look to this day .  You may bring up your corps .                              Major Taylor, have Traveler saddled up .                              - I\\'m going to look around for myself .  - Yes, sir .                              They\\'ve got a brigade in position  and that\\'s all .                              We\\'ve got the best damn ground around,  and they\\'re hitting me with one brigade .                              Lovely .                              Go on down, gentlemen .                              Fall back !                              They are on the run .                              Close crop, General .                              - How are your losses ?  - Not bad at all, sir .                              We got them out in the open .  Really got a twist on them .                              They are arrogant people, you know ?  They came right at us .                              We took some prisoners .  They\\'re from Heth\\'s division of Hill\\'s corps .                              That\\'s what I\\'ve got in front of me .                              A new division .      men more or less .  All within sound of this .                              Just back up that road between here  and Cashtown . A little ways up the road .                              It\\'ll take them a little while to get on line .                              Yes, sir, but Hill\\'s whole corps is behind .  Maybe       .                              Longstreet behind that .  Ewell over there to the north .                              I know, Colonel .                              When John Reynolds gets here,  he won\\'t have the full army with him .                              Only part of it .                              The point is, the rebs will be here  this afternoon . . .                              with everything they\\'ve got .  I just thought I\\'d mention it .                              What do you want me to do here, sir ?                              Heth will be back in a bit .                              If he\\'s got any brains at all,  and he\\'s not stupid . . .                              he\\'ll know by now he\\'s got at least  a brigade in front of him .                              He won\\'t wait  to get his whole division in line .                              That would take half the morning .                              He don\\'t need his whole division .                              That\\'s right .                              Does Devin report any activity on his front  over to the right ?                              - No, sir . Not a lick .  - All right .                              I\\'ll have Devin leave his cover  and withdraw his boys . . .                              and have them move in alongside you,  lengthening your line .                              When Heth gets back,  he\\'ll run into two brigades .                              That ought to hold him  until Reynolds gets here .                              Right, sir .                              Damn sure glad the rain is gone .  Don\\'t want anything to slow up Reynolds .                              Take care of yourself, Colonel .                              Don\\'t worry about me, sir .  I\\'m the soul of caution .                              Fire !                              Move ! Fall back !                              That flank . . . Hold it !                              Keep up your fire !                              Gamble\\'s down, sir .                              Colonel Gamble, but he\\'s not hurt bad, sir .                              I\\'m all right .                              It was close, that\\'s all .                              Sir, Colonel Devin\\'s compliments .  No problem on the right .                              They came up close,  but we put in the reserve .                              We didn\\'t put it all in, sir .                              Wishes to know if you have further orders .                              Tell Devin all reserve forward, now .                              Keep up your fire !                              Fire !                              Fire !                              Sir, it\\'s General Reynolds .                              Thank God .                              What goes, John ?                              There\\'s the devil to pay !                              - Can you hold ?  - I reckon I can .                              Heth probably has about       men  coming down that road, wouldn\\'t you say ?                              Yes, sir . But there\\'ll be more behind him .                              We can put almost       in the field .  We\\'re in very good shape, I think .                              For a while, sir .                              I\\'m sending messages to all commanders  to come here with all possible speed .                              It\\'s lovely ground .                              I thought so, sir .                              Now let\\'s go surprise Harry Heth .                              Come on .                              - General Heth .  - Sir . I beg to report .                              Yes .                              Very strange, sir .  The situation is very confused .                              What happened ?                              I moved in this morning, as directed .                              I thought it was only a few militia,  but it was dismounted cavalry, sir .                              There weren\\'t all that many,  and the boys wouldn\\'t hold back .                              I thought we shouldn\\'t be stopped  by a few dismounted cavalry . . .                              but they made a good fight .                              They really put up a scrap, sir .                              Go on, General .                              Well, sir, they wouldn\\'t leave .                              My boys got their dander up .                              We deployed the whole division  and went after them .                              We just about had them running  then all of a sudden . . .                              they got infantry support .                              We got pushed back .                              Then we re-formed and tried again .  We couldn\\'t just leave it to them, sir .                              Now there\\'s more Yankee infantry coming .  I don\\'t know how many .                              But I don\\'t know  what else we could\\'ve done .                              It started as a minor scrap  with a few militia .                              The next thing I know,  I\\'m tangling with half the Union army .                              Things will get out of control, Mr . Heth .  That is why we have orders .                              - Is it possible you misunderstood them ?  - No, sir .                              Can you identify those people ?                              The infantry is the First Corps,  the Black Hats .                              There\\'s another corps coming  that we haven\\'t identified .                              I must have all possible information  on enemy strength .                              Major Taylor, I want you to ride forward  to the highest position and observe .                              - And do be careful .  - Yes, sir .                              - Sir, shall I attack ?  - No, sir .                              We are not ready for full engagement .                              General Longstreet is not up  with his corps .                              Sir, the enemy is disorganized .                              If we throw all our forces in the field,  we will have the advantage .                              Is that our artillery ?                              Yes, sir .                              I can\\'t imagine what has happened  to General Stuart .                              - I\\'ve heard nothing . Do you understand ?  - Yes, sir .                              I have no idea of what lies in front of me .  It may be the entire federal army .                              Sir, compliments of Colonel Babbit .                              Rebels are coming from the north .  Your instructions, sir ?                              That\\'ll be Ewell\\'s corps .  They\\'re trying to flank us .                              We got to meet them  and force them to go on line .                              Tell Colonel Devin to get up that way  as quick as he can .                              We\\'ll get Gamble\\'s boys back in the saddle  and be there shortly .                              General Rodes has encountered  Yankee cavalry, sir .                              Buford\\'s brigades .                              General Early\\'s right behind him  and will be on the field within the hour .                              General Early may be attacked  by half the federal army within the hour .                              - Is that Pender\\'s artillery ?  - Yes, sir . He\\'s up now, sir .                              Four batteries in position  with two more in reserve .                              With General Rodes attacking up there  and Pender and I, we have three divisions .                              We could sweep them .                              General, sir .                              I saw only two federal corps .  First and Eleventh .                              And, General, I saw Early\\'s lead columns  coming down north of Rodes\\' lines .                              He\\'ll be engaged any minute, sir .                              Sir, we got       infantry coming down  almost behind the Union lines .                              It\\'s perfect, sir .                              God\\'s will .                              Gentlemen, it would appear  the fight is already underway .                              General Heth, you may attack, sir .                              My orders to all commanders: Attack .                              Fire !                              Forward men, final brigade forward !                              Forward ! For God\\'s sake, forward !                              He\\'s dead .                              One thing about this brigade  is we got our own special bugle call .                              Ever hear tell of Dan Butterfield ?                              What, General Butterfield ?  What was with Hooker ?                              That\\'s the same fellow .                              - He used to be our brigade commander .  - Yeah, he was a pistol .                              - No man like him for having a good time .  - I don\\'t know about that .                              But I know he used to like  to write bugle calls .                              The problem with this army is,  we got too many calls .                              We got a call for artillery, infantry,  get up and eat, retreat .                              Anyway, old Butterfield, he wrote  a special call for this here brigade .                              Say there is an order for this brigade,  you and me .                              He\\'ll be blowing his bugle, we will think  that order\\'s for us when it wasn\\'t .                              We\\'ll follow that order anyway,  then we\\'ll be in a world of hurt .                              Yeah, that happened to me once .  Us, that is .                              Half the regiment charged,  the other half retreated .                              You had your choice .                              This here brigade got a special call .                              You hear that call,  you know the next one is for you .                              It goes like this .                              Colonel, sir .                              Begging the Colonel\\'s pardon .                              But would the Colonel please do us a favor  and get back on the damned horse ?                              I\\'ll tell you, sir,  it\\'s not easy handling these new recruits . . .                              when the officers act  like they ain\\'t got any sense, sir .                              Lawrence, sir .                              We\\'ve gone over    miles today .                              We\\'ve gone over     miles  in five days, sir .                              There\\'s something going on .                              - Colonel Vincent, sir .  - Mister Chamberlain .                              Far cry from Bowdoin College,  wouldn\\'t you say ?                              No farther than Harvard Yard .                              Indeed . With luck, we\\'ll both see  our alma maters again .                              In the meantime, Colonel, you move  your boys along as best you can .                              Two corps have engaged at Gettysburg .                              So we\\'ll keep going through dark  and on until we get there .                              Yes, sir .                              Godspeed .                              Fire !                              They\\'re running !                              General Pender begs to report  that the enemy is falling back .                              - They\\'re on the run .  - Very well, Lieutenant .                              General Early says the enemy has caved in  on the left flank, going back to Gettysburg .                              - They\\'re all running .  - Very well . Thank you, Corporal .                              Find General Hill\\'s chief of artillery .                              Tell him I want fire placed on that hill .  As much fire as possible .                              - Yes, sir .  - Very well .                              - Major Taylor .  - Yes, sir .                              Deliver this message in person .                              Tell General Ewell the federal troops  are withdrawing in confusion .                              We must only push those people  in order to gain the heights .                              Tell him to take that hill, if practical .  The one beyond the town .                              Do you understand ?                              - Yes, sir .  - Very well .                              Congratulations, General .                              I want you to see this .                              It\\'s like second Manassas all over again .                              Couldn\\'t have worked better  if we\\'d planned it .                              If we can take that hill,  I want it occupied by nightfall .                              Sir, the federal army has fallen back  through Gettysburg .                              They\\'re reforming on the ridges  outside of town .                              Very well .                              This is almost perfect .  We got them where we want them .                              Let\\'s move south and east,  get between them and Lincoln . . .                              find some high ground . . .                              and they\\'ll have to hit us .                              Then we have them, General .                              You mean disengage ?                              I\\'ve always been under the impression . . .                              that it was our strategy to conduct  a defensive campaign wherever possible . . .                              in order to keep the army intact .                              Granted, but the situation has changed .                              - In what way ?  - We\\'ve already pushed them back .                              They\\'re on the run, vacating the town .                              How can we move off  in the face of the enemy ?                              - Major Marshall ?  - Yes, sir .                              I ordered firing on that hill,  but no cannons are firing .                              - Send over and find out why .  - I\\'ll see to it, sir .                              Thank you .                              What are you thinking, General ?                              Maybe we should not have fought here .                              I know that . But we have prevailed .  The men have prevailed .                              Yes . They\\'ve always done that .                              But in the morning,  we may be outnumbered . . .                              and they\\'ll be entrenched  on the high ground .                              You know as well as I, we\\'ve never been  concerned with being outnumbered .                              That is true, sir . You are right .                              If we move south to Washington,  they have to pursue us .                              Then we can fight on ground  of our choosing .                              But the enemy is here .                              We did not want the fight,  but the fight is here .                              How can I ask this army to retreat  in the face of what they\\'ve done this day ?                              Not retreat, sir . Re-deploy .                              Our guns will move them off that hill  or Ewell will push them off .                              But if Meade is there tomorrow,  I can\\'t move this army away .                              I will attack him .                              If Meade is up there tomorrow,  it is because he wants us to attack him .                              We pushed back two corps,  but there are five more coming .                              General, I will bring up my boys  as soon as I can .                              Very well .                              - General ?  - Sir ?                              Your man Harrison, the actor,  he was quite correct .                              Had it not been for him, this entire army  might have been destroyed in detail .                              The federal force might\\'ve been here  waiting when we turned around .                              I\\'m deeply grateful to you, sir .                              Hello, men .                              What outfit are you with ?                              Archer\\'s brigade, Heth\\'s division .                              - Where are you from ?  - Tennessee .                              How about you ?                              Maine .                              I\\'ve never been to Tennessee .                              I reckon I\\'ve never been to Maine neither .                              I don\\'t mean no disrespect  to you fighting men . . .                              but sometimes I can\\'t help but figure,  why are you fighting this war ?                              Why are you fighting it ?                              To free the slaves, of course .  And to preserve the Union .                              I don\\'t know about other folk,  but I ain\\'t fighting for no darkies .                              I\\'m fighting for my rights .                              That\\'s what we\\'re all fighting for .                              For your what ?                              For our rights .                              Why is it you folks can\\'t just live  the way you want to live . . .                              and let us live the way we do ?                              \"Live and let live,\" I hear some folks say .                              Be a mite less fuss and bother  if more folks took it to heart .                              Where\\'d you get captured ?                              Railroad cut just west of Gettysburg town .                              It wasn\\'t a pretty sight .                              Many a good boy lost  a young and promising life .                              Some wore blue, some wore gray .                              Seen enough of this war ?                              I guess I have .                              I guess I have, too .                              It looks like I\\'ll be sitting out the rest of it .                              I appreciate you talking to me .                              See you in hell, Billy Yank .                              See you in hell, Johnny Reb .                              I have found a John Henry, sir .                              John who ?                              A John Henry, sir . A runaway .  I heard him a-groaning .                              Is he wounded ?                              Don\\'t know for sure .                              The man\\'s exhausted .                              We\\'ll get him something to eat .  The surgeon\\'s on the way .                              - Did you get his name ?  - He said something I couldn\\'t understand .                              I can\\'t understand anyone  south of Mason-Dixon .                              Rebs or darkies .                              All right, men, as you were .  Surgeon, see to him .                              We used to have visitors from the South  before the war .                              They were always very polite, academic,  you understand .                              We stayed off the question of slavery  out of courtesy .                              But toward the end there was  no getting away from it . . .                              and yet I could never understand .  I don\\'t now .                              I don\\'t know why .                              They fight so well .                              Tell me something, Buster . . .                              what do you think of Negroes ?                              Well, if you mean the race . . .                              I don\\'t really know .                              This is not a thing to be ashamed of .                              The thing is, you cannot judge a race .                              Any man who judges by the group  is a pea-wit .                              You take men one at a time .                              To me, there was never any difference .                              - None at all ?  - None at all .                              Of course, I haven\\'t known  that many freed men . . .                              but those I knew in Bangor, Portland . . .                              you look in the eye, there was a man .                              There was a \"divine spark,\"  as my mother used to call it .                              That is all there is to it .                              Races are men .                              \"What a piece of work is man .                              \"How infinite in faculties,  in form and moving . . .                              \"how express and admirable .                              \"In action, how like an angel .\"                              Well, if he\\'s an angel, all right then . . .                              but he damn well must be a killer angel .                              Colonel, darling, you\\'re a lovely man .                              I see a great vast difference between us,  yet I admire you, lad .                              You\\'re an idealist, praise be .                              The truth is, Colonel . . .                              there is no \"divine spark .\"                              There\\'s many a man alive no more of value  than a dead dog . Believe me .                              When you\\'ve seen them hang each other  the way I have back in the Old Country .                              Equality ?                              What I\\'m fighting for is the right to prove  I\\'m a better man than many of them .                              Where have you seen this \"divine spark\"  in operation, Colonel ?                              Where have you noted  this magnificent equality ?                              No two things on earth are equal  or have an equal chance .                              Not a leaf, not a tree .                              There\\'s many a man worse than me  and some better . . .                              but I don\\'t think race or country  matters a damn .                              What matters, Colonel . . .                              is justice .                              Which is why I\\'m here .                              I\\'ll be treated as I deserve . . .                              not as my father deserved .                              I\\'m Kilrain . . .                              and I damn all gentlemen .                              There is only one aristocracy . . .                              and that is right here .                              And that\\'s why we\\'ve got to win this war .                              Howdy .                              Howdy, General .                              Hello, my boys . Virginia has arrived !                              General Pickett presents  his compliments . . .                              and asks to \"parler\" with  the commanding general, \"s\\'il vous plat\" .                              Hey, George .                              General .                              Good Lord, what is that smell ?                              That\\'s me . Ain\\'t it lovely ?                              He got it off a dead Frenchman .                              - Good evening to you, James .  - Hey, Lo .                              I did not get it off a dead Frenchman .                              I bought it in a store  in Richmond with Sally .                              It did have a French name,  but Miss Corbert likes it .                              Excuse me .                              Gentlemen ? Colonel Fremantle ?                              Allow me to introduce  Major General George Pickett .                              General Pickett,  Lieutenant Colonel Arthur Fremantle . . .                              of Her Majesty\\'s venerable  and elite Cold Stream Guards . . .                              Britain\\'s military attach\"\"  to the Confederacy . . .                              and, you might say,  the eyes and ears of Queen Victoria .                              Hardly, sir . I\\'m merely an observer  and your humble guest .                              The fame of your regiment  has preceded you .                              General Pickett here  is our ranking strategist .                              The First Corps Army of Northern Virginia .  We refer all our deeper questions to him .                              They do . They do indeed .                              His record at West Point  is still the talk of both armies .                              You know I consider it unbecoming  to a soldier, all this book learning .                              - Book learning ain\\'t for gentlemen, right ?  - Nor that either .                              He graduated last in his class . Dead last .                              Quite a feat, considering his classmates .                              The Yankees got all the smart ones .  Look where it\\'s got them .                              Let me present my commanders .                              Each one of these chaps, as you might say,  commands a brigade of mine .                              Now this fellow here, this is Lo Armistead .                              Lo ! That\\'s short for Lothario .                              The lover !                              This here is Richard Brooke Garnett .  You\\'ll pardon his limp .                              He got kicked by his horse the other day .                              That fellow there . . .                              That\\'s Jim Kemper .                              You note the shifty eye,  the hand in the pocket .                              He\\'s not even a West Pointer,  so watch him .                              He\\'s a politician from Virginia .  Jimmy\\'s only here for the votes .                              I was Speaker of the House in Virginia .                              As a matter of fact, I\\'d like to talk to you  about some political matters .                              You know the Queen, don\\'t you ?                              What I need to know  and tell my folks back home is:                              When are you going to do something . . .                              about that damn Yankee blockade  out there on the water ?                              Can you tell me something about that ?                              Have you heard any news of old Winfield ?                              Old Winnie boy ?                              Hancock ? Oh, yeah .                              Well, how\\'s he doing ?                              You\\'re going to find out .                              He\\'s got the Second Corps .                              He\\'s headed this way . Probably run  into him in the next few days .                              I wish I could see him again .                              I haven\\'t seen him since before the war .                              Never thought it would last this long .                              Me neither, Lo .                              I sure would like to talk  to old Hancock again .                              One more time .                              Well, why not ?                              You wouldn\\'t mind ?                              Hell, no .                              I mean, really .                              Do you think it would be proper ?  You know, ethical ?                              When the time comes, and he\\'s close . . .                              just send a messenger over  under a flag of truce and go on over .                              Ain\\'t nothing to it .                              Last time I saw him was in California .                              Right when the war was beginning . . .                              the night before we all left  to go fight against each other .                              Old friends off to war .                              How\\'s your brigade ?                              I\\'ve never seen troops anywhere  so ready for a brawl .                              I\\'ve got to give the old man credit .  A lot of credit for that .                              Who else could\\'ve held  this army together for so long ?                              Remember what they used to say  about him ?                              When he first took command ?  They called him \"Old Granny .\"                              Lord, what damn fools we were .                              Now when he passes . . .                              the boys hush as if they had seen  an angel of the Lord .                              Have you ever seen anything like that ?                              No . I can\\'t say I have .                              It\\'s amazing what one honest man can do .                              One honest man and a cause .                              I don\\'t think on that too much anymore .                              I guess my only cause is victory .                              This war comes as a nightmare .  You pick your nightmare side .                              Then you put your head down and win .                              Old gloomy Pete !                              You see, Colonel . . .                              The government derives its power  from the consent of the people .                              Every government, everywhere .                              Let me make this very plain to you, sir .                              We do not consent  and we will never consent .                              And what you\\'ve got to do is,  you\\'ve got to go back over there . . .                              to your Parliament and you\\'ve got  to make it very plain to them .                              You\\'ve got to tell them  that what we\\'re fighting for here . . .                              is the freedom from what we consider  to be the rule of a foreign power .                              I mean, that\\'s all we want .  That\\'s what this war is all about .                              Now we established this country  in the first place . . .                              with very strong state governments . . .                              just for that very reason .                              I mean, let me put it to you this way .                              My home is in Virginia .                              The government of my home is home .                              Virginia would not allow itself  to be ruled . . .                              by some king over there in London .                              It\\'s not about to let itself be ruled  by some president in Washington .                              Virginia, by God, sir,  is going to be run by Virginians .                              Oh, my . The Cause .                              Actually, Jimmy, I got a pair of kings .                              And it\\'s all for the Yankees .                              The damn money-grubbing Yankees .                              I mean, those damn fools,  they don\\'t get the message .                              Always the darkies .  Nothing but the darkies .                              You know, Jim . . .                              Sit down . I think that my idea . . .                              my analogy of a gentlemen\\'s club  is fair enough . It\\'s clear enough .                              Colonel, think on it now .                              Suppose that we all joined a club,  a gentlemen\\'s club .                              After a time, several of the members  began to intrude themselves . . .                              into our private lives, our home lives .                              Began telling us  what we could and couldn\\'t do .                              Well, then, wouldn\\'t any one of us  have the right to resign ?                              I mean, just resign .                              That\\'s what we did .                              That\\'s what I did and now these people  are telling us we don\\'t have that right .                              I got to hand it to you .                              You certainly do have a talent  for trivializing the momentous . . .                              and complicating the obvious .                              Have you ever considered  running for Congress ?                              No . It\\'s a thought .                              What does Colonel Fremantle think ?                              Will the British come in on our side ?                              Hell, yeah . They\\'ll come in  when we don\\'t need them no more .                               Like some damn bank lending you money  when you\\'re no longer in debt .                               - Look here, Mr . Speaker . . .  - George .                               A word ?                               Goodnight, Colonel .                               See you later .                               In the next few days, I believe  we\\'re going to have a hell of a fight here .                               I want you to do everything necessary  to get your boys ready .                               You can start bringing them up  by the first light .                               I want you all in Gettysburg  by tomorrow night .                               Yes, sir .                               Good evening, John .                               I\\'m surprised you could find headquarters  with all that confusion .                               There\\'s an old Indian saying:                               \"Follow the cigar smoke  and find a fat man there .\"                               General Hancock .                               How are you, John ?                               I\\'m all right .                               But the brigades are pretty shot up .  I need to get refitted .                               Right . I\\'ll see to it .  We know what you did this morning .                               - That was one hell of a piece of soldiering .  - Thank you, sir .                               Heard you were with John Reynolds  when he was killed .                               I\\'m sending the body up  to his folks in Lancaster .                               They might appreciate a note from you .                               I\\'ll send it .                               He was a soldier .                               And a good friend .                               Three of us, Reynolds,  Lo Armistead and I came up together .                               Mexican War .                               California .                               We stayed close .                               I wonder how old Lo is doing .  If he\\'s still alive .                               Heard he had one of Pickett\\'s brigades .                               Under Longstreet .                               Remarkable .                               Just across the ridge .                               I\\'d like to see him again, but not here .  Not like this .                               Well, maybe after the war .                               Where do you want me in the morning ?                               I want you to hold your position  on the extreme left .                               Get some rest if you can .                               We may need you in the morning .                               Jeb Stuart\\'s still on the prowl  out there someplace .                               Yes, sir .                               Well, General Reynolds . . .                               we held the high ground .                               General Trimble is waiting .                               - Will you see him now ?  - Very well .                               Major, I want a scouting party sent out  posthaste to find General Stuart .                               - Yes, sir . Right away, sir .  - Thank you .                               General Trimble .                               Sir, I most respectfully request  another assignment .                               Do please go on, General .                               The man is a disgrace .                               Sir, have you been listening at all  to what the aides have been telling you ?                               Ask General Gordon or General Ewell .  Ask them .                               We could\\'ve taken that hill .                               God in his wisdom knows  we should\\'ve taken it .                               There was no one there at all  and it commanded the town .                               General Gordon saw it .  I mean, he was with us .                               Me and Ewell and Gordon . . .                               all standing in the dark like idiots  with that bloody damned hill empty .                               I beg your pardon, General .                               That bloody damned hill was bare  as his bloody damned head !                               We all saw it, as God is my witness .                               We were all there .                               I said to him, \"General Ewell,  we have got to take that hill .\"                               General Jackson wouldn\\'t have stopped  with them on the run . . .                               and plenty of light  on a hill like that empty .                               God help us !                               I don\\'t know . . .                               I don\\'t know why . . .                               Do please continue, General .                               Yes, sir .                               Sir .                               I said to General Ewell these words . . .                               I said to him:                               \"Sir, give me one division  and I will take that hill .\"                               He said nothing .  He just stood there and stared at me .                               I said, \"General Ewell,  give me one brigade . . .                               \"and I will take that hill .\"                               I was becoming disturbed, sir .                               And General Ewell put his arms  behind him and blinked .                               So I said,  \"General, give me one regiment . . .                               \"and I will take that hill .\"                               And he said nothing .                               He just stood there .                               I threw down my sword .  Down on the ground in front of him .                               We could have done it, sir .                               A blind man should have seen it .                               Now they\\'re working up there .                               You can hear the axes  of the federal troops .                               And so in the morning . . .                               many a good boy will die . . .                               taking that hill .                               Sir .                               I must request another assignment .                               No, sir . That won\\'t be necessary .                               You will be of great service .                               And I do thank you .                               General Meade, sir .                               Hancock . It\\'s so damn dark out there  I can\\'t see a thing .                               Gentlemen .                               I hope to God that this is . . .                               good ground .                               Is this good ground, General ?                               Is this a place to have an army ?                               Very good ground, sir .                               I hope you are right .                               Because we are going to have a fight here  sure enough in the morning .                               - Will there be anything else, sir ?  - No, thank you, Major .                               Very well .                               In the morning is the great battle .                               Tomorrow or the next day  will determine the war .                               Virginia is here .                               All the South is here .                               What will you do tomorrow ?                               In the morning . . .                               the enemy will be up  in fortified positions on high ground .                               Longstreet\\'s corps will be coming up . . .                               and my boys will be ready  to finish the job .                               If I tell them to withdraw now ? No, sir .                               They\\'ve been patient for far too long .                               With the enemy out there up on the hill . . .                               they\\'ll be ready to finish the job .                               But I don\\'t even know  how much is up there .                               How many men ? How many cannon ?                               I don\\'t know the ground on the flanks .                               I don\\'t know .                               If I wait in the morning,  the early morning . . .                               maybe Meade, under pressure, will attack .                               That would make General Longstreet  very happy .                               But I don\\'t think Meade will come down .                               And I don\\'t think I can withdraw, so . . .                               God\\'s will, thy will be done .                               Major Sorrel, you\\'ve met before .                               Thank you, General .                               The federal position was scouted  during the last several hours .                               We\\'ve drawn it up here .                               Now this is the situation .                               The position of the federal army  is in the shape of a fishhook .                               It starts here . You see these two hills ?                               This one and the one with the cemetery .                               That is where they have concentrated  their troops .                               The hook starts there .                               Now it curves around and comes down  this low ridge to the south .                               Ending before two round hills  of high elevation .                               The federals have no troops  on those two hills .                               - Carry on, Major .  - Thank you .                               We now know that General Hancock  is in charge of the Union center .                               There are now perhaps        to       men already in position .                               Perhaps as high as       .                               I spoke with General Ewell  of your suggestion . . .                               that we move around to the right  to flank the federal army .                               And he is of the opinion that  withdrawing from Gettysburg . . .                               and giving it back to the enemy  would be very bad for morale .                               It is unnecessary .  It might even be dangerous .                               Do you disagree ?                               We must attack .                               I would prefer not to fight  upon this ground . . .                               but every moment we delay  the enemy uses to reinforce himself .                               We cannot support ourselves for long  in this country .                               We must not allow the federal army  to move around behind . . .                               and cut us off from home . No, sir .                               We must strike him now .                               We pushed him yesterday  and he will remember it .                               The men are ready and they are eager .  I see no useful alternative .                               Yes, sir .                               Very well .                               Gentlemen .                               - Good morning, all .  - Good morning, sir .                               Longstreet will attack on the right  with the First Corps .                               Hill will support . . .                               with Heth in reserve .                               Ewell\\'s people on the left  will demonstrate to keep the enemy . . .                               from reinforcing against our right flank .                               Yes, sir . But I still don\\'t have Pickett .                               He\\'s at the rear of column,  a full day\\'s march .                               All I\\'ve got is Hood and McLaws .                               I do believe that Hood\\'s  and McLaws\\' divisions will be sufficient .                               - With the General\\'s permission .  - General Hood ?                               Moving in front of those rocky heights,  we\\'ll have enfilade fire . . .                               coming down on us .                               Perhaps, but not for long . Your division . . .                               will be up over this unoccupied hill,  the little, rocky one .                               From there you will threaten  the enemy flank .                               When you\\'re heavily engaged,  General Ewell will strike from the left .                               Very well, sir .                               - General ?  - Let\\'s move out, gentlemen .                               General Barksdale,  is Mississippi ready for this day ?                               - Mississippi is ready .  - Very well .                               Let\\'s go to it, Sam .                               If he\\'s right, General Lee . . .                               then the war is over by sundown .                               We\\'ll see .                               I don\\'t like going in without Pickett .                               It\\'s like going in with one boot off .                               I\\'ll wait as long as I can .                               Do you have any idea of the force ?                               We counted five corps, including  the two involved in yesterday\\'s action .                               That don\\'t mean how many might be . . .                               hidden behind those hills there .                               And, damn it, with Stuart gone  there ain\\'t no way of knowing for sure .                               Take good care of yourself today,  you hear ?                               You, too, Pete .                               With your permission, sir .                               I don\\'t believe I\\'ve had the pleasure .                               That\\'s Major General John Bell Hood,  but we call him Sam .                               One of my three division commanders .  Fellows from Texas and Alabama .                               You\\'ve been to Texas, as I recall .                               Yes . Actually that\\'s where I came through .                               Courtesy of the Yankee Navy  who denied me any other point of entry .                               It\\'s a marvelous place, Texas .                               Full of red Indians and Mexicans . . .                               cowboys, bandits and desperados .                               Even hotter and more humid  than this place .                               If that\\'s possible .                               That fellow Hood . . .                               does his performance in battle  match his appearance ?                               He really does look the part .                               He does his job .                               Most interesting army, I must say .                               Virginia gentlemen fighting  alongside Texas frontiersmen . . .                               and bayou bushwhackers from Louisiana .                               Drawn together from across a continent .                               Having traveled a good piece of it myself,  I feel a part . . .                               or almost a member of this enterprise .                               You call yourselves Americans,  but you\\'re really transplanted Englishmen .                               Look at your names, Lee, Hood . . .                               Longstreet, Jackson, Stuart .                               My people were Dutch .                               And the same for your adversaries .  Meade, Hooker, Hancock, and . . .                               shall I say ? Lincoln .                               The same God . Same language .  Same culture and history .                               The same songs, stories, legends, myths .                               But different dreams .                               Different dreams .                               It\\'s so very sad . Very sad .                               You English had your own civil war once,  didn\\'t you ?                               That was ages ago .  We wouldn\\'t dream of it now .                               Cavaliers and Roundheads .                               \"Off with his head !\"                               Heads lying everywhere .                               One could hardly take a step  without tripping over a fallen crown .                               We\\'re much more civilized now .                               I assure you .                               We have so much in common,  your country and mine .                               I earnestly hope  that we shall become allies .                               Your government would never ally itself  with a Confederacy . . .                               that had the institution of slavery .  You know that . So do I .                               We should have freed the slaves,  then fired on Fort Sumter .                               I guess we Southerners and you English  have at least one thing in common .                               We\\'d rather lose the war  than admit to the mistake .                               We whupped you British twice  as I recollect .                               Your candor is admirable,  if somewhat eccentric .                               A little eccentricity is good for a general .                               We Southerners like our men religious  and a little bit mad .                               I suspect that\\'s why the women  fall in love with preachers .                               In nomine pater, et filii, et spiritus sancti .                               Amen .                               General Longstreet .                               Do you mind if I accompany you ?                               Not at all . I\\'m very glad  to have you with us, sir .                               The heat reminds me of Mexico .                               Yes, but there it was very dry .                               That was a good outfit .                               I remember storming the ramparts  of Chapultapec with old George Pickett .                               Reynolds . . . My old friend,  Ulysses Sam Grant .                               - There was some good men in that army .  - Yes, indeed .                               Some of those men are waiting for us now  up ahead on those ridges .                               I don\\'t know . I sometimes feel troubled .                               Those fellows, those boys in blue,  they never quite seem the enemy .                               I know .                               I used to command some of those boys .  Swore an oath, too .                               I couldn\\'t fight against Georgia  and South Carolina .                               Not against my own family .                               No, sir . There was always a higher duty  to Virginia .                               That was our first duty .                               There was never any question about that .                               - I guess so .  - Let us not think about that now .                               The issue is in God\\'s hands .                               We can only do our duty .                               General ?                               Soldiering has one great trap .                               To be a good soldier  you must love the army .                               To be a good commander,  you must be willing to order the death . . .                               of the thing you love .                               We do not fear our own death, you and I .                               But there comes a time . . .                               We are never quite prepared  for so many to die .                               We do expect the occasional empty chair .  A salute to fallen comrades . . .                               but this war goes on and on  and the men die . . .                               and the price gets ever higher .                               We are prepared to lose some of us,  but we are never prepared to lose all of us .                               And there is the great trap, General .                               When you attack,  you must hold nothing back .                               You must commit yourself totally .                               We are adrift here in a sea of blood,  and I want it to end .                               I want this to be the final battle .                               I woke up this morning and I half thought  he\\'d be gone, George Meade .                               That he would not want to fight here .  Yes, sir .                               I woke up and I thought,  \"Meade will be gone . . .                               \"and this war will go on and on and on .\"                               We\\'ll make him sorry he stayed .                               God go with you, General .                               And with you, General .                               That\\'s mostly to the south .                               I thought the rebs were all in Gettysburg .  You don\\'t suppose they\\'re flanking again ?                               Mama\\'s favorite . Let\\'s go .                               Lawrence, what\\'s happening ?                               Sir, Corporal Estabrook reporting back, sir .                               - Brook, I thought you were on sick call .  - Yes, sir .                               How are you now ?                               It\\'s my stomach .  I\\'ve been throwing up, sir .                               It\\'s something you ate .                               - Finish up . We\\'re about to move out .  - Yes, sir .                               - Colonel Chamberlain .  - Colonel Vincent .                               Form your men .  Follow me and prepare to double-quick .                               We\\'re going to the top of that hill,  right there .                               - You hear that ?  - Yes, sir . I\\'ll set it up .                               The rebels are stacking up  on our left flank .                               And we\\'ve got to follow them .                               - Make haste .  - Yes, sir .                               Sound the assembly !                               Follow me .                               Powder in ! Load !                               General .                               Look here,  the ground is strewn with boulders .                               The soldiers up there are entrenched  all over the ground .                               And there are guns in the rocks .                               Every move I make is observed .                               If I attack as ordered,  I lose half my division .                               And they\\'ll be looking down our throats  at us from that hill right there .                               We must move around to the right, sir .                               And take them from the rear .                               The commanding general will not allow  a flanking movement around those hills .                               I argued it yesterday .  I argued it all morning .                               I\\'ve been arguing against any attack at all .                               I can\\'t call this one off . You know it .                               Let me move up the big round hill  to the south .                               Nobody is on that .  If I could get a battery up there . . .                               There ain\\'t enough time .                               You\\'d have to cut down trees  to place your artillery .                               It would be dark before you were in action .                               One the other hand,  if they get batteries up there . . .                               we\\'ll need buckets to catch the lead .  You\\'ve got to take that hill .                               They don\\'t even need guns to defend that .                               All they need to do  is roll rocks down on you .                               Just take it .                               General .                               I do this under protest .                               Sam, you are the best I got .                               Now, sir, if you are ready,  why don\\'t you take that hill ?                               They\\'re overshooting again .                               Hey, fellows, you notice how  that reb artillery always overshoots ?                               - Tom ?  - Yes, sir .                               Another one a bit closer  and it could be hard day for Mother .                               Go back to the rear .  Watch out for stragglers .                               Keep your distance from me .                               Lawrence, I don\\'t . . .                               The whole damn reb army is down there . . .                               and coming up around our flanks .  They could be here any minute .                               We\\'ve got to hold this place .  We\\'ve got to hold it .                               Well, all right . I place you here .                               Put your colors here, and set  your regiment to the left of this line .                               The rest of the brigade  will form on your right . Understood ?                               - Yes . Ellis, this is the point .  - Sir .                               Your regiment is to the left of this point .                               - Colonel, sir . You\\'re the end of the line .  - Yes .                               You\\'re the extreme left of the Union army .  Understood ?                               The line runs from here  back to Cemetery Hill . . .                               - but it ends here .  - Understood .                               You can\\'t withdraw under any condition .                               If you go, this line will be flanked .                               If you go, the enemy will sweep up  over the hillside . . .                               and take this entire army from the rear .                               - You must defend this place to the last .  - Yes, sir .                               Now we\\'ll see how professors fight .                               Ellis, position the regiment .  All company commanders here .                               Yes, sir .                               Sharpshooters to the left !                               Battalion on the right !                               Now file into line . March .                               Bugler, sound the officer\\'s call .                               \"Hold to the last .\" To the last what ?                               Exercise in rhetoric .                               Last shell ? Last man ?                               Last foot of ground ? Last reb ?                               Advance !                               Move out !                               Turn those guns around !                               The   rd Pennsylvania,   th New York,  and   th Michigan . . .                               will be moving in to our right .  But if you look left, you will see . . .                               that there is no one there .                               Because we\\'re the end of the line .  The Union army stops here .                               We are the flank .                               Do you understand, gentlemen ?                               We cannot retreat . We cannot withdraw .                               We are going to have  to be stubborn today .                               Put the boys in position,  tell them to stay down .                               Pile the rocks up high  for the best protection you can .                               I want the reserve pulled back  about    yards .                               Sloping ground is good ground .                               If you have any breakthroughs,  men wounded, a hole in the line . . .                               plug it with the reserve .  How\\'s our ammunition ?                               Sir, I think about    rounds per man .                               That\\'s good .    rounds . I think . . .  Yes, that\\'s adequate .                               Any questions ?                               Colonel .                               It seems to me  the fighting is on that side of the hill .                               It seems to me that we\\'re the back door .                               And everything\\'s going on  at the front door .                               That hill is steep and rocky . It\\'s bare .  To come straight up it is impossible .                               The reb army is going to swing around it .                               It\\'ll come up through that notch  right over there .                               It\\'ll move under the cover of trees,  trying to get around the flank .                               And gentlemen . . .                               we are the flank .                               Gentlemen .                               God go with you .                               Captain Clark,  take the right side from the   rd . . .                               over in this direction to the center .                               Ellis, take the left but be watchful .  Your flank will be in the air .                               - Colonel, sir .  - Corporal Estabrook ?                               What do I do with these prisoners ?  The hardheads of the Second Maine .                               Do any of you care to join us ?                               - The rebs really coming ?  - They\\'re really coming .                               Well, it\\'s kind of dull  just sitting here watching, sir .                               For any man who joins us,  there will be no court martial .                               No man will call me a coward .                               Why not ?                               I\\'ll waste no man to guard you .  I expect you to be here when this is over .                               - Let\\'s get these fellows some muskets .  - There are no muskets, sir .                               Wait here for a bit .                               There will be guns available  in a little while .                               That\\'s the New York boys .  The rebs must be getting closer .                               Must be moving this way .                               Private Foss is praying .                               - Will you put in a kind word for me ?  - Yes, sir .                               - You\\'re the Merrill brothers, right ?  - Yes, sir .                               Boys, why aren\\'t you on the ground ?                               Sir, I can\\'t shoot worth a darn lying down .                               Never could . Bill neither .  We like to fight standing .                               I suggest you find a thicker tree .                               Here they come !                               I want you to stay with me,  but you keep down .                               Buster !                               I bet the whole damn reb army  is coming this way .                               Walk down the line .  Tell the boys to get good cover .                               Pile the rocks high and fire carefully .                               - Go down and come back .  - Right .                               You got to keep an eye on them .                               Some of them load but never fire .  They just keep right on loading .                               Some come home with  eight bullets rammed up the barrel .                               Never fired a shot .                               Sir .                               Fire !                               Keep up your fire, boys !                               Keep your head down .                               Watch your left side .                               Keep up your fire !                               They\\'re falling back .                               They\\'ll be back in a minute .                               - How are we doing ?  - We\\'re doing fine .                               - Colonel .  - Captain Clark, anybody hurt ?                               - Head and shoulder wounds .  - They didn\\'t hit the left .                               They\\'re moving out that way .  Can you see them, sir ?                               They\\'re coming again, boys !                               Colonel, look here .                               A new regiment has arrived  that\\'s moving against the left .                               It\\'s out there . Do you see them ?                               Double-quick !                               I don\\'t think we\\'ll be able  to hold another one .                               - Get all company commanders up here .  - On the double .                               - Sergeant Owen !  - Yes, sir .                               Get up to the top of that hill  and report me the situation from up there .                               Yes, sir .                               We\\'re about to be flanked .  Here\\'s what we\\'ll do .                               I want you to keep up  a good hot masking fire .                               Keep a tight hold on the   rd,  on old Pennsylvania over there .                               I want no break in the line .                               Captain Clark, that\\'s you .  You understand ? No breaks .                               Right wing will sidestep to the left . . .                               thinning out to twice the present distance .                               You see the colors ?  They will end up down to the extreme left .                               When you reach that point,  we are going to refuse the line .                               Understand ?                               We\\'ll form a new line at right angles .                               We\\'ll pull up as much of a reserve  as possible .                               We\\'ve got to be able to counter-attack  whenever there\\'s a hole .                               - Any questions ?  - No, sir .                               Fine . Move !                               Lieutenant . You fellows, on the double .                               Come on !                               - How are you, Andrew ?  - I\\'m fine, sir . And you ?                               A bit worn .                               - The boys are putting up a hell of a fight .  - They are indeed .                               I got me one . I got me a reb .                               Buster ! Are you all right ?                               I\\'ll be fine in a minute,  but plays hell with me target practice .                               The surgeon will see to it .                               No . A little bandage is all I\\'ll be needing .                               A few minutes off my feet .  Me brogans are killing me .                               Colonel, my men are getting low  on ammunition .                               Go over to the   rd .  Ask them to send what they can .                               Lieutenant, go get from the wounded  and from the others anything you can .                               - Pick up what you can from anywhere .  - Here they come, sir !                               Keep up the fire !  Fill your holes down here !                               There they go !                               I\\'ll be damned .                               They keep coming !  How long are they going to keep coming ?                               I don\\'t have much left . I got two shots .  That\\'s what I got .                               They keep coming on the flanks .  They keep moving to the left more .                               They can\\'t send help from the   rd .  They say they got their own troubles .                               - Colonel, sir ! We\\'d like to report .  - What ?                               Vincent is badly wounded .                               He got hit a few minutes  after the fight started .                               We\\'ve been reinforced at the top of the hill  by Weed\\'s brigade up front .                               This is what they tell me .  But Weed is dead .                               So they moved Hazlett\\'s  battery of artillery up there .                               But Hazlett\\'s dead . Far as I can tell . . .                               Can you can get ammunition  from up there ?                               I don\\'t know . It\\'s a mess .  But they\\'re holding good .                               The rebs are having a hard time climbing .                               - It\\'s a steep hill .  - We\\'ll need the ammunition .                               Colonel, sir, the better of my men  are wounded .                               If the rebs come up that hill any stronger,  we can\\'t stop them .                               Send out word to take ammunition  from the wounded .                               - Make every round count . Go !  - Here they come again !                               Ready, boys !                               Come on, keep it coming ! Keep it up, lads !                               Pour it on, boys !                               Keep at them ! Keep up your fire !                               Here they come, boys !                               Go plug that hole over there !                               Sir, half my men are down .                               Most of the rest are wounded .  The left is too thin .                               - How is our ammunition ?  - Almost gone .                               Sir, we\\'re running out .  We don\\'t have much left to shoot with .                               Some boys got nothing at all .                               What do we do for ammunition ?                               My boys had to pick up reb muskets  and fired back with them .                               - We ought to pull out .  - No, we can\\'t do that .                               We can\\'t hold them again, sir .                               If we don\\'t, they go right over the hill  and the flank caves in .                               Here they come .                               We can\\'t run away .  If we stay here, we can\\'t shoot .                               So let\\'s fix bayonets .                               We\\'ll have the advantage  moving down the hill .                               They must be tired if we are .  So fix bayonets .                               Ellis, you take the left wing .  I\\'ll take the right .                               Right wheel forward, the whole regiment .                               - You mean charge ?  - Yes, but here\\'s what we do .                               We\\'re going to charge  swinging down the hill .                               Just like we pulled back to the left side . . .                               we\\'ll swing it down like a door .                               We\\'ll sweep them down the hill  as they come up . Understand ?                               - Does everybody understand ?  - Yes, sir .                               Ellis, take the left wing .                               When I command, the whole regiment  goes forward swinging down to the right .                               All right, sir . Fine .                               Move .                               Bayonets !                               Come on ! Let\\'s go ! Move !                               Quickly, boys ! Quickly !                               Let\\'s go !                               Bayonets !                               Draw !                               Bayonets !                               Left swing, right wheel .                               Right wheel !                               Charge !                               Charge !                               Go !                               The pistol .                               Your prisoner, sir .                               Wait here .                               By God, Colonel,  the boys are still advancing .                               - You better stop them .  - They\\'re on their way to Richmond .                               - Richmond !  - They\\'ve done enough for today .                               I want you to meet  this fellow from Alabama .                               Captain Hawkins, this is my brother,  Colonel Chamberlain .                               Sir .                               May I have some water ?                               Yes .                               Sure . Tom, get this man a canteen .                               Yes, sir . Right this way .                               How you doing ?                               Twice !                               Would you believe, for the love of Mary ?                               Twice .                               And how are you, Colonel, darling,  this fine day ?                               I got it in the armpit .                               For the love of God, in the bloody armpit .                               How is he ?                               It\\'s an arm .                               Only an arm . You got to lose something .                               It might as well be an arm .                               I can part with that easier than other  mechanics of nature, and that\\'s the truth .                               I could do with a nip right now .                               I\\'ll see what I can do .                               You do pretty good .                               Colonel . . .                               I\\'m right here, Buster . I\\'m right here .                               The army was blessed .                               I want to tell you, just in case . . .                               that I never served . . .                               I\\'ve never served with a better man .                               Don\\'t worry, sir .                               He\\'ll make it . He\\'s a tough old mick .                               Colonel, sir . It would so honor me .                               Colonel, sir . I\\'ve been moving these rebs  with an empty musket .                               That\\'s allowed .                               You\\'re ordered to go to the top  of the big hill .                               - My New Yorkers will take your prisoners .  - Yes, sir .                               We watched from our position above .                               It\\'s the damnedest thing I ever saw .                               May I shake your hand, sir ?                               Colonel, one thing .  The name of this place, this hill . . .                               Has it got a name, this hill ?                               This is Little Round Top .  That\\'s the name of the hill you defended .                               The big one you\\'re going up to,  that\\'s Big Round Top .                               Is that so ? I guess I\\'ll remember that .                               Ellis, move the men out .  I\\'m going to go ahead .                               Sam ?                               We drugged him, sir .                               It\\'d be better if he slept .                               Didn\\'t see much .                               The boys went in . Hit the rocks .                               How did it go, Pete ?                               Fine, Sam .                               We take those rocks ?                               Most of them .                               Worst . . .                               ground I ever saw .                               You know that ?                               They call it . . .                               Devil\\'s Den . It\\'s a good name for it .                               What casualties ?                               Don\\'t know yet .                               Got to give my boys credit .                               You should\\'ve let me go to the right .                               We should\\'ve gone to the right .                               He needs to rest some .                               You summoned me, sir ?                               Harrison .                               I did .                               I\\'ve got some night work .                               Are you up to it ?                               \"All the world will be in love with night . . .                               \"And pay no worship to the garish sun .\"                               When this is all over,  I do look forward to seeing you on stage .                               What are the General\\'s wishes ?                               I want you to go out on the right,  scout the federal position .                               Their condition, what they\\'ve got  in reserve, what they\\'re bringing up .                               It\\'ll probably take all night .  But I want it right and clear .                               - Your obedient servant, General .  - Good .                               Now, Harrison, it\\'ll be dangerous .  And I do appreciate this .                               Thank you, sir .                               But I must confess,  the thing that bothers me about this job . . .                               is the absence of an audience .                               When you do it right, no one knows it .                               Nobody ever watches your work .  Do you see ?                               That\\'s very hard on an actor .                               Go on .                               General, I\\'m very glad to see you well .                               I\\'ve just come by for my orders, sir .                               It would appear  that General Stuart has returned .                               The prodigal son .                               It was very close this afternoon .                               Sir ?                               They nearly broke .                               I could feel them breaking .                               There for a moment I thought I saw  our flags go up the hill .                               It wasn\\'t that close .                               The attacks were not properly  coordinated . I do not know why .                               And nevertheless, we nearly won the day .                               I could see a clear road  all the way to Washington .                               How is it with General Hood ?                               I think he\\'ll live . May lose an arm .                               Dear God .                               I couldn\\'t spare General Hood .                               So many good men were lost this day .                               Sir ?                               Lo did take the peach orchard  and wheat field .                               But he couldn\\'t get up that ridge .                               And Hood, he seized the Devil\\'s Den,  but he couldn\\'t take the little rocky hill .                               The federals still hold the heights .  And they\\'re reinforced .                               General ?                               That way around to the right is still open .                               I will think on it, General .                               We have enough artillery  for one more good fight, but just one .                               I know .                               Let me think on it .                               - General . . .  - I am very glad to see you well .                               We will speak again in the morning .                               You know, hearing you talk  about monkeys and trees . . .                               I remember the time  during a cannonade on the peninsula .                               There was one tree  for the men to hide behind .                               It was a skinny little tree  and the boys, they fell in behind it . . .                               in a long thin line  which ruled just like a pigtail .                               It swayed to one side, then the other .                               A shell came this way,  the line swayed that way .                               A cannonball came that way,  the line swayed this way .                               It was a thing to see .                               George, what has that got to do  with what we\\'re talking about ?                               General .                               Carry on, gentlemen .  Don\\'t let me interrupt the revival .                               General, you\\'re just in time .                               I\\'ve been trying to persuade George here  of the modern, scientific . . .                               theories of Charles Darwin .  The theory of evolution .                               The notion that all mankind  is descended from the ape .                               He does not subscribe .                               - Is that so ?  - I do not .                               I\\'ve ordered General Armistead to stop  filling his head with heathen blasphemies .                               Now, you are to devote  your reflective moments to study . . .                               in the matters of military significance .                               Ordered me .                               Or perhaps appropriating  some more of this fine whiskey here .                               Absolutely .                               - Would you care for ?  - No, thank you .                               Surely the commanding general  shares my deep feelings of disgust . . .                               at this simian suggestion .                               I suppose there\\'s some pretty smart folk  that take Darwin for the Gospel .                               They would not be invited to join  George\\'s ever-shrinking circle of friends .                               General Longstreet, sir .                               I intend to lay this matter to rest  for once and for all time .                               Good .                               Perhaps there are those among you who  think that you are descended from an ape .                               I suppose it\\'s possible  there are those of you . . .                               who believe that I\\'m descended  from an ape, but . . .                               I challenge the man to step forward . . .                               who believes that General Lee  is descended from an ape .                               - Here, here .  - Not likely .                               All science trembles before  the searing logic of your fiery intellect .                               So, exactly how many of your relatives  are there that are apes ?                               What do you hear about Sam Hood ?                               He may lose an arm .                               Dick Garnett isn\\'t fit . Can\\'t hardly walk .                               Thing is, if there\\'s a fight,  he can\\'t stand to stay out of it .                               But if you ordered him to stay out . . .                               I don\\'t suppose you could do that .                               That boy can sing .                               That\\'s \"Kathleen Mavourneen\" .                               What do you hear about Hancock ?                               Ran into him today .                               He\\'s out there about a mile or so .                               Just a mile or so . And he was tough .                               Very tough today .                               He\\'s the best they got .                               God don\\'t make them any better .  And that\\'s a fact .                               I\\'d like to go over to see him  as soon as I can .                               The last time I saw Winn . . .                               he played that song . That very song .                               Back in California,  we were all together for the last time .                               Before we broke up .                               Spring of      .                               Myra Hancock .                               Do you remember Myra, Hancock\\'s wife ?                               Beautiful woman .                               Most perfect woman I ever saw .                               They were a beautiful couple .                               Beautiful .                               Garnett was with me that night .                               A lot of fellows from the old outfit .  People standing around singing . . .                               in the blue uniform .                               We were leaving the next day .                               Some going north . Some going south .                               Splitting up .                               A soldier\\'s farewell .                               \"Goodbye . Good luck .                               \"I\\'ll see you in hell .\"                               Do you remember that ?                               Towards the end of the evening . . .                               we all sat around the piano .                               And Myra played . . .                               that song there,  that was the one she played .                               Maybe for years, maybe forever . . .                               I\\'ll never forget that .                               You know how it was, Pete .                               Winn was like a brother to me .                               Remember ?                               Towards the end of the evening . . .                               things got a little rough .                               We all began to . . .                               There were a lot of tears .                               I went over to Hancock .                               I took him by the shoulder . I said:                               \"So help me . . .                               \"if I ever raise my hand against you . . .                               \"may God strike me dead .\"                               I haven\\'t seen him since .                               He was at Malvern Hill . . .                               White Oak Swamp,  Sharpsburg, Fredericksburg .                               One of these days  I will see him, I\\'m afraid .                               Across that . . .                               small deadly space .                               I thought about sitting this one out .                               But I can\\'t do that .                               That wouldn\\'t be right either .                               I guess not .                               Thank you, Peter .                               I had to talk about that .                               I\\'m sending Myra Hancock . . .                               a small package to be opened . . .                               in the event of my death .                               You\\'ll drop by and see her . . .                               after this is over .                               Won\\'t you, Pete ?                               Thank you .                               What day is it now, Major ?                               It\\'s long after midnight, sir .                               It\\'s already Friday .                               - Friday, July   ?  - Yes, sir .                               Then tomorrow is the Fourth of July .                               Independence Day .                               - I\\'d quite forgotten .  - The good Lord has a sense of humor .                               I\\'m very sorry to keep you up so late .                               It is my pleasure .                               We should have a larger staff .                               I\\'d be offended, sir .                               I can do the work .                               Very well .                               General Stuart is waiting to see you, sir .                               - Shall I bring him in ?  - Of course .                               - Major ?  - Yes, sir .                               General Stuart and I  must not be disturbed .                               - Very well, sir .  - Thank you .                               General Lee will see you now, sir .                               You wish to see me, sir .                               It is the opinion of some excellent officers  that you have let us all down .                               Sir, if you will please tell me  who these gentlemen are ?                               There will be none of that .  There is no time .                               I ask that I be allowed to defend my . . .                               There is no time .                               General Stuart .                               Your mission was to free this army . . .                               from the enemy cavalry .                               And to report any movement  by the enemy\\'s main body .                               That mission was not fulfilled .                               You left here . . .                               with no word of your movement  or movement of the enemy for days .                               Meanwhile we were engaged  and drawn into battle . . .                               without adequate knowledge  of the enemy\\'s strength or position .                               Without knowledge of the ground .                               So it is only by God\\'s grace  that we did not meet disaster here .                               General Lee, there were reasons .                               Perhaps you misunderstood my orders .                               Perhaps I did not make myself clear .                               Well, sir, this must be made very clear .                               You, sir . . .                               with your cavalry,  are the eyes of this army .                               Without your cavalry, we are made blind .                               That has already happened once .                               It must never, never happen again .                               - Since I no longer hold the General\\'s . . .  - I told you there is no time for that !                               There is no time .                               There is another fight coming tomorrow  and we need you .                               We need every man . God knows .                               You must take what I have told you . . .                               and learn from it as a man does .                               There has been a mistake .                               It will not happen again .  I know your quality .                               You are one of the finest  cavalry officers I have ever known . . .                               and your service to this army  has been invaluable .                               Let us speak no more of this .                               The matter is concluded .  Goodnight, General .                               Colonel, sir .                               What are you doing up here ?                               I\\'m just resting my leg .                               All right .                               You sure can see a ways from here .                               Where have you been ?                               We sent out a detail . . .                               and found some more departed souls  down there . . .                               and they were carrying coffee  for which they had no more use for .                               You\\'re a ghoul .                               You did real good yesterday .                               The way them rebs just kept coming .                               You had to admire them .                               You think they\\'ll come again today ?                               It don\\'t look like they\\'re planning to leave .                               We don\\'t have but     men .                               Even with the whole flock  from the Second Maine .                               This position\\'s good .                               Diversion .                               Go alert the pickets .                               That may be a diversion .  They may be coming this way again .                               Where\\'s the ammunition I asked for ?                               Go check the hospital, see about the boys .  Check on Buster .                               Very well, sir .                               We need another runner .                               I keep going up and down this hill,  my legs are going to fall off .                               - Good morning, General .  - Good morning, sir .                               - Ride with me, if you will .  - Yes, sir .                               General Longstreet, you have  General Pickett now and he is fresh .                               I want you to bring your corps forward .                               Take those heights in the center  and split the federal line .                               My two divisions, Hood\\'s and McLaws\\' . . .                               They executed a forced march yesterday  and went straight into the fight .                               Lost half of their strength .                               Sustained   % casualties, sir .                               They are tired and need rest .                               There are . . .                               now three federal corps on those two  rocky hills on our right flank .                               If I move all my people forward . . .                               we won\\'t have a flank at all .                               They\\'ll simply swing around and crush us .                               They are well entrenched up there .  They aim to fight .                               They got good artillery and plenty of it .                               Sir, any attack we make  will be uphill over open ground .                               How do we communicate ?  How do we coordinate attack ?                               They\\'re all massed together,  damned near in a circle .                               Good interior lines .                               Anywhere we hit them,  they\\'ll bring up reinforcements in minutes .                               But we try to bring up support,  it has to come from miles away .                               Their cannon will see every move .                               Hell, their cannon are looking down  on us right now .                               In the center, they will break .                               They will break in the center .                               They\\'ll be gaining men from all directions,  guns by the thousands . . .                               and Richmond has nothing left  to send us . So, if we stay, we fight .                               If we retreat now,  we will have fought here for two days . . .                               and will leave knowing  we could not drive him off .                               And I have never yet left the enemy  in command of the field . No, sir .                               Retreat is no longer an option .                               The enemy has been attacked  on both wings .                               He has reinforced there . . .                               and is strongest there on the wings .  The hills and the rocks .                               So the weak point is in the center .                               They have command of the high ground .                               But in that long slope, you see there ?                               The long slope in the center,  there\\'s where he\\'s most vulnerable .                               General Pickett\\'s Virginians  are the only people not yet engaged . Yes ?                               With General Longstreet in command,  my old warhorse . . .                               meeting the enemy face to face  on ground of his choosing . . .                               and with honor, we will prevail .                               Sir, a courier from Colonel Rice .                               Colonel Chamberlain .                               That\\'s some climb, sir .                               My men need rations, Lieutenant .                               Colonel Rice has entrusted me to tell you  that you\\'re relieved, sir .                               Relieved ?                               Fresh troops are on their way up  and they\\'ll take over here, sir .                               Colonel Rice wants to give  your people a rest .                               He wants you to fall back,  and I\\'m to show you the way .                               Fall back .                               Ellis, have the men fall in .  We\\'re moving out .                               Yes, sir .                               Where are we going ?                               Lovely spot .                               Very quiet . Safest place on the battlefield .                               Right smack-dab in the center .                               Yes, sir, General .                               We will attack the center .                               But I think you are right about the flank .                               Hood and McLaws were both very badly  damaged yesterday .                               I\\'ll give you two other divisions:  General Pettigrew and General Trimble .                               They are stronger and rested .                               Now, you will have nearly three divisions  at your command, including Pickett .                               Your objective will be  that clump of trees yonder .                               The attack will be preceded  by massed artillery .                               We\\'ll concentrate all of our guns  on that one small area .                               A \"feu d\\'enfer\", as Napoleon would call it .                               When the artillery has had its effect,  your charge will break the line .                               You will have nearly       men  at your command, General .                               You may begin whenever you\\'re ready .                               But plan it well .  Do plan it well, I pray you, sir .                               We stake everything on this .                               With your permission .                               Sir, I\\'ve been a soldier all my life .                               I have served from the ranks on up .  You know my service .                               I must tell you now,  I believe this attack will fail .                               No       men ever made  can take that ridge .                               It\\'s a distance of more than a mile  over open ground .                               When the men come out of the trees  they will be . . .                               under fire of Yankee artillery  from all over the field .                               Those are Hancock\\'s boys .                               And now they have the stone wall  like we did at Fredericksburg .                               We do our duty, General .                               We do what we must do .                               Yes, sir .                               Colonel Alexander is in charge  of the artillery and he is very good .                               We will depend on him to drive them off  the ridge before your divisions get there .                               And the men will know what to do .  All       . . .                               will concentrate squarely on the center  of that line . That lower ridge there .                               The line is not strong there .                               General Meade has great strength  on both flanks .                               He must be weak in the center .                               I estimate his strength in the center  not to be more than      men .                               And Colonel Alexander\\'s artillery  will break them up like at Fredericksburg .                               - Yes, sir .  - Farewell .                               What are you thinking, General ?                               Pickett\\'s division is from my corps .                               But the other two units  are of A .P . Hill\\'s corps .                               Shouldn\\'t General Hill lead the attack ?                               Say again ?                               Shouldn\\'t General Hill lead the attack ?                               My apologies, sir .                               I\\'ve always been very cautious .                               Very cautious .                               There is no one I trust more .                               If we can take that ridge . . .                               We can . And we will .                              Go plug that hole over there !                            Sir, half my men are down .                            Most of the rest are wounded .  The left is too thin .                            - How is our ammunition ?  - Almost gone .                            Sir, we\\'re running out .  We don\\'t have much left to shoot with .                            Some boys got nothing at all .                            What do we do for ammunition ?                            My boys had to pick up reb muskets  and fired back with them .                            - We ought to pull out .  - No, we can\\'t do that .                             We can\\'t hold them again, sir .                             If we don\\'t, they go right over the hill  and the flank caves in .                             Here they come .                             We can\\'t run away .  If we stay here, we can\\'t shoot .                             So let\\'s fix bayonets .                             We\\'ll have the advantage  moving down the hill .                             They must be tired if we are .  So fix bayonets .                             Ellis, you take the left wing .  I\\'ll take the right .                             Right wheel forward, the whole regiment .                             - You mean charge ?  - Yes, but here\\'s what we do .                             We\\'re going to charge  swinging down the hill .                             Just like we pulled back to the left side . . .                             we\\'ll swing it down like a door .                             We\\'ll sweep them down the hill  as they come up . Understand ?                             - Does everybody understand ?  - Yes, sir .                             Ellis, take the left wing .                             When I command, the whole regiment  goes forward swinging down to the right .                             All right, sir . Fine .                             Move .                             Bayonets !                             Come on ! Let\\'s go ! Move !                             Quickly, boys ! Quickly !                             Let\\'s go !                             Bayonets !                             Draw !                             Bayonets !                             Left swing, right wheel .                             Right wheel !                             Charge !                             Charge !                             Go !                             The pistol .                             Your prisoner, sir .                             Wait here .                             By God, Colonel,  the boys are still advancing .                             - You better stop them .  - They\\'re on their way to Richmond .                             - Richmond !  - They\\'ve done enough for today .                             I want you to meet  this fellow from Alabama .                             Captain Hawkins, this is my brother,  Colonel Chamberlain .                             Sir .                             May I have some water ?                             Yes .                             Sure . Tom, get this man a canteen .                             Yes, sir . Right this way .                             How you doing ?                             Twice !                             Would you believe, for the love of Mary ?                             Twice .                             And how are you, Colonel, darling,  this fine day ?                             I got it in the armpit .                             For the love of God, in the bloody armpit .                             How is he ?                             It\\'s an arm .                             Only an arm . You got to lose something .                             It might as well be an arm .                             I can part with that easier than other  mechanics of nature, and that\\'s the truth .                             I could do with a nip right now .                             I\\'ll see what I can do .                             You do pretty good .                             Colonel . . .                             I\\'m right here, Buster . I\\'m right here .                             The army was blessed .                             I want to tell you, just in case . . .                             that I never served . . .                             I\\'ve never served with a better man .                             Don\\'t worry, sir .                             He\\'ll make it . He\\'s a tough old mick .                             Colonel, sir . It would so honor me .                             Colonel, sir . I\\'ve been moving these rebs  with an empty musket .                             That\\'s allowed .                             You\\'re ordered to go to the top  of the big hill .                             - My New Yorkers will take your prisoners .  - Yes, sir .                             We watched from our position above .                             It\\'s the damnedest thing I ever saw .                             May I shake your hand, sir ?                             Colonel, one thing .  The name of this place, this hill . . .                             Has it got a name, this hill ?                             This is Little Round Top .  That\\'s the name of the hill you defended .                             The big one you\\'re going up to,  that\\'s Big Round Top .                             Is that so ? I guess I\\'ll remember that .                             Ellis, move the men out .  I\\'m going to go ahead .                             Sam ?                             We drugged him, sir .                             It\\'d be better if he slept .                             Didn\\'t see much .                             The boys went in . Hit the rocks .                             How did it go, Pete ?                             Fine, Sam .                             We take those rocks ?                             Most of them .                              Worst . . .                              ground I ever saw .                              You know that ?                              They call it . . .                              Devil\\'s Den . It\\'s a good name for it .                              What casualties ?                              Don\\'t know yet .                              Got to give my boys credit .                              You should\\'ve let me go to the right .                              We should\\'ve gone to the right .                              He needs to rest some .                              You summoned me, sir ?                              Harrison .                              I did .                              I\\'ve got some night work .                              Are you up to it ?                              \"All the world will be in love with night . . .                              \"And pay no worship to the garish sun .\"                              When this is all over,  I do look forward to seeing you on stage .                              What are the General\\'s wishes ?                              I want you to go out on the right,  scout the federal position .                              Their condition, what they\\'ve got  in reserve, what they\\'re bringing up .                              It\\'ll probably take all night .  But I want it right and clear .                              - Your obedient servant, General .  - Good .                              Now, Harrison, it\\'ll be dangerous .  And I do appreciate this .                              Thank you, sir .                              But I must confess,  the thing that bothers me about this job . . .                              is the absence of an audience .                              When you do it right, no one knows it .                              Nobody ever watches your work .  Do you see ?                              That\\'s very hard on an actor .                              Go on .                              General, I\\'m very glad to see you well .                              I\\'ve just come by for my orders, sir .                              It would appear  that General Stuart has returned .                              The prodigal son .                              It was very close this afternoon .                              Sir ?                              They nearly broke .                              I could feel them breaking .                              There for a moment I thought I saw  our flags go up the hill .                              It wasn\\'t that close .                              The attacks were not properly  coordinated . I do not know why .                              And nevertheless, we nearly won the day .                              I could see a clear road  all the way to Washington .                              How is it with General Hood ?                              I think he\\'ll live . May lose an arm .                              Dear God .                              I couldn\\'t spare General Hood .                              So many good men were lost this day .                              Sir ?                              Lo did take the peach orchard  and wheat field .                              But he couldn\\'t get up that ridge .                              And Hood, he seized the Devil\\'s Den,  but he couldn\\'t take the little rocky hill .                              The federals still hold the heights .  And they\\'re reinforced .                              General ?                              That way around to the right is still open .                              I will think on it, General .                              We have enough artillery  for one more good fight, but just one .                              I know .                              Let me think on it .                              - General . . .  - I am very glad to see you well .                              We will speak again in the morning .                              You know, hearing you talk  about monkeys and trees . . .                              I remember the time  during a cannonade on the peninsula .                              There was one tree  for the men to hide behind .                              It was a skinny little tree  and the boys, they fell in behind it . . .                              in a long thin line  which ruled just like a pigtail .                              It swayed to one side, then the other .                              A shell came this way,  the line swayed that way .                              A cannonball came that way,  the line swayed this way .                              It was a thing to see .                              George, what has that got to do  with what we\\'re talking about ?                              General .                              Carry on, gentlemen .  Don\\'t let me interrupt the revival .                              General, you\\'re just in time .                              I\\'ve been trying to persuade George here  of the modern, scientific . . .                              theories of Charles Darwin .  The theory of evolution .                              The notion that all mankind  is descended from the ape .                              He does not subscribe .                              - Is that so ?  - I do not .                              I\\'ve ordered General Armistead to stop  filling his head with heathen blasphemies .                              Now, you are to devote  your reflective moments to study . . .                              in the matters of military significance .                              Ordered me .                              Or perhaps appropriating  some more of this fine whiskey here .                              Absolutely .                              - Would you care for ?  - No, thank you .                              Surely the commanding general  shares my deep feelings of disgust . . .                              at this simian suggestion .                              I suppose there\\'s some pretty smart folk  that take Darwin for the Gospel .                              They would not be invited to join  George\\'s ever-shrinking circle of friends .                              General Longstreet, sir .                              I intend to lay this matter to rest  for once and for all time .                              Good .                              Perhaps there are those among you who  think that you are descended from an ape .                              I suppose it\\'s possible  there are those of you . . .                              who believe that I\\'m descended  from an ape, but . . .                              I challenge the man to step forward . . .                              who believes that General Lee  is descended from an ape .                              - Here, here .  - Not likely .                              All science trembles before  the searing logic of your fiery intellect .                              So, exactly how many of your relatives  are there that are apes ?                              What do you hear about Sam Hood ?                              He may lose an arm .                              Dick Garnett isn\\'t fit . Can\\'t hardly walk .                              Thing is, if there\\'s a fight,  he can\\'t stand to stay out of it .                              But if you ordered him to stay out . . .                              I don\\'t suppose you could do that .                              That boy can sing .                              That\\'s \"Kathleen Mavourneen\" .                              What do you hear about Hancock ?                              Ran into him today .                              He\\'s out there about a mile or so .                              Just a mile or so . And he was tough .                              Very tough today .                              He\\'s the best they got .                              God don\\'t make them any better .  And that\\'s a fact .                              I\\'d like to go over to see him  as soon as I can .                              The last time I saw Winn . . .                              he played that song . That very song .                              Back in California,  we were all together for the last time .                              Before we broke up .                              Spring of      .                              Myra Hancock .                              Do you remember Myra, Hancock\\'s wife ?                              Beautiful woman .                              Most perfect woman I ever saw .                              They were a beautiful couple .                              Beautiful .                              Garnett was with me that night .                              A lot of fellows from the old outfit .  People standing around singing . . .                              in the blue uniform .                              We were leaving the next day .                              Some going north . Some going south .                              Splitting up .                              A soldier\\'s farewell .                              \"Goodbye . Good luck .                              \"I\\'ll see you in hell .\"                              Do you remember that ?                              Towards the end of the evening . . .                              we all sat around the piano .                              And Myra played . . .                              that song there,  that was the one she played .                              Maybe for years, maybe forever . . .                              I\\'ll never forget that .                              You know how it was, Pete .                              Winn was like a brother to me .                              Remember ?                              Towards the end of the evening . . .                              things got a little rough .                              We all began to . . .                              There were a lot of tears .                              I went over to Hancock .                              I took him by the shoulder . I said:                              \"So help me . . .                              \"if I ever raise my hand against you . . .                              \"may God strike me dead .\"                              I haven\\'t seen him since .                              He was at Malvern Hill . . .                              White Oak Swamp,  Sharpsburg, Fredericksburg .                              One of these days  I will see him, I\\'m afraid .                              Across that . . .                              small deadly space .                              I thought about sitting this one out .                              But I can\\'t do that .                              That wouldn\\'t be right either .                              I guess not .                              Thank you, Peter .                              I had to talk about that .                              I\\'m sending Myra Hancock . . .                              a small package to be opened . . .                              in the event of my death .                              You\\'ll drop by and see her . . .                              after this is over .                              Won\\'t you, Pete ?                              Thank you .                              What day is it now, Major ?                              It\\'s long after midnight, sir .                              It\\'s already Friday .                              - Friday, July   ?  - Yes, sir .                              Then tomorrow is the Fourth of July .                              Independence Day .                              - I\\'d quite forgotten .  - The good Lord has a sense of humor .                              I\\'m very sorry to keep you up so late .                              It is my pleasure .                              We should have a larger staff .                              I\\'d be offended, sir .                              I can do the work .                              Very well .                              General Stuart is waiting to see you, sir .                              - Shall I bring him in ?  - Of course .                              - Major ?  - Yes, sir .                              General Stuart and I  must not be disturbed .                              - Very well, sir .  - Thank you .                              General Lee will see you now, sir .                              You wish to see me, sir .                              It is the opinion of some excellent officers  that you have let us all down .                              Sir, if you will please tell me  who these gentlemen are ?                              There will be none of that .  There is no time .                              I ask that I be allowed to defend my . . .                              There is no time .                              General Stuart .                              Your mission was to free this army . . .                              from the enemy cavalry .                              And to report any movement  by the enemy\\'s main body .                              That mission was not fulfilled .                              You left here . . .                              with no word of your movement  or movement of the enemy for days .                              Meanwhile we were engaged  and drawn into battle . . .                              without adequate knowledge  of the enemy\\'s strength or position .                              Without knowledge of the ground .                              So it is only by God\\'s grace  that we did not meet disaster here .                              General Lee, there were reasons .                              Perhaps you misunderstood my orders .                              Perhaps I did not make myself clear .                              Well, sir, this must be made very clear .                              You, sir . . .                              with your cavalry,  are the eyes of this army .                              Without your cavalry, we are made blind .                              That has already happened once .                              It must never, never happen again .                              - Since I no longer hold the General\\'s . . .  - I told you there is no time for that !                              There is no time .                              There is another fight coming tomorrow  and we need you .                              We need every man . God knows .                              You must take what I have told you . . .                              and learn from it as a man does .                              There has been a mistake .                              It will not happen again .  I know your quality .                              You are one of the finest  cavalry officers I have ever known . . .                              and your service to this army  has been invaluable .                              Let us speak no more of this .                              The matter is concluded .  Goodnight, General .                              Colonel, sir .                              What are you doing up here ?                              I\\'m just resting my leg .                              All right .                              You sure can see a ways from here .                              Where have you been ?                              We sent out a detail . . .                              and found some more departed souls  down there . . .                              and they were carrying coffee  for which they had no more use for .                              You\\'re a ghoul .                              You did real good yesterday .                              The way them rebs just kept coming .                              You had to admire them .                              You think they\\'ll come again today ?                              It don\\'t look like they\\'re planning to leave .                              We don\\'t have but     men .                              Even with the whole flock  from the Second Maine .                              This position\\'s good .                              Diversion .                              Go alert the pickets .                              That may be a diversion .  They may be coming this way again .                              Where\\'s the ammunition I asked for ?                              Go check the hospital, see about the boys .  Check on Buster .                              Very well, sir .                              We need another runner .                              I keep going up and down this hill,  my legs are going to fall off .                              - Good morning, General .  - Good morning, sir .                              - Ride with me, if you will .  - Yes, sir .                              General Longstreet, you have  General Pickett now and he is fresh .                              I want you to bring your corps forward .                              Take those heights in the center  and split the federal line .                              My two divisions, Hood\\'s and McLaws\\' . . .                              They executed a forced march yesterday  and went straight into the fight .                              Lost half of their strength .                              Sustained   % casualties, sir .                              They are tired and need rest .                              There are . . .                              now three federal corps on those two  rocky hills on our right flank .                              If I move all my people forward . . .                              we won\\'t have a flank at all .                              They\\'ll simply swing around and crush us .                              They are well entrenched up there .  They aim to fight .                              They got good artillery and plenty of it .                              Sir, any attack we make  will be uphill over open ground .                              How do we communicate ?  How do we coordinate attack ?                              They\\'re all massed together,  damned near in a circle .                              Good interior lines .                              Anywhere we hit them,  they\\'ll bring up reinforcements in minutes .                              But we try to bring up support,  it has to come from miles away .                              Their cannon will see every move .                              Hell, their cannon are looking down  on us right now .                              In the center, they will break .                              They will break in the center .                              They\\'ll be gaining men from all directions,  guns by the thousands . . .                              and Richmond has nothing left  to send us . So, if we stay, we fight .                              If we retreat now,  we will have fought here for two days . . .                              and will leave knowing  we could not drive him off .                              And I have never yet left the enemy  in command of the field . No, sir .                              Retreat is no longer an option .                              The enemy has been attacked  on both wings .                              He has reinforced there . . .                              and is strongest there on the wings .  The hills and the rocks .                              So the weak point is in the center .                              They have command of the high ground .                              But in that long slope, you see there ?                              The long slope in the center,  there\\'s where he\\'s most vulnerable .                              General Pickett\\'s Virginians  are the only people not yet engaged . Yes ?                              With General Longstreet in command,  my old warhorse . . .                              meeting the enemy face to face  on ground of his choosing . . .                              and with honor, we will prevail .                              Sir, a courier from Colonel Rice .                              Colonel Chamberlain .                              That\\'s some climb, sir .                              My men need rations, Lieutenant .                              Colonel Rice has entrusted me to tell you  that you\\'re relieved, sir .                              Relieved ?                              Fresh troops are on their way up  and they\\'ll take over here, sir .                              Colonel Rice wants to give  your people a rest .                              He wants you to fall back,  and I\\'m to show you the way .                              Fall back .                              Ellis, have the men fall in .  We\\'re moving out .                              Yes, sir .                              Where are we going ?                              Lovely spot .                              Very quiet . Safest place on the battlefield .                              Right smack-dab in the center .                              Yes, sir, General .                              We will attack the center .                              But I think you are right about the flank .                              Hood and McLaws were both very badly  damaged yesterday .                              I\\'ll give you two other divisions:  General Pettigrew and General Trimble .                              They are stronger and rested .                              Now, you will have nearly three divisions  at your command, including Pickett .                              Your objective will be  that clump of trees yonder .                              The attack will be preceded  by massed artillery .                              We\\'ll concentrate all of our guns  on that one small area .                              A \"feu d\\'enfer\", as Napoleon would call it .                              When the artillery has had its effect,  your charge will break the line .                              You will have nearly       men  at your command, General .                              You may begin whenever you\\'re ready .                              But plan it well .  Do plan it well, I pray you, sir .                              We stake everything on this .                              With your permission .                              Sir, I\\'ve been a soldier all my life .                              I have served from the ranks on up .  You know my service .                              I must tell you now,  I believe this attack will fail .                              No       men ever made  can take that ridge .                              It\\'s a distance of more than a mile  over open ground .                              When the men come out of the trees  they will be . . .                              under fire of Yankee artillery  from all over the field .                              Those are Hancock\\'s boys .                              And now they have the stone wall  like we did at Fredericksburg .                              We do our duty, General .                              We do what we must do .                              Yes, sir .                              Colonel Alexander is in charge  of the artillery and he is very good .                              We will depend on him to drive them off  the ridge before your divisions get there .                              And the men will know what to do .  All       . . .                              will concentrate squarely on the center  of that line . That lower ridge there .                              The line is not strong there .                              General Meade has great strength  on both flanks .                              He must be weak in the center .                              I estimate his strength in the center  not to be more than      men .                              And Colonel Alexander\\'s artillery  will break them up like at Fredericksburg .                              - Yes, sir .  - Farewell .                              What are you thinking, General ?                              Pickett\\'s division is from my corps .                              But the other two units  are of A .P . Hill\\'s corps .                              Shouldn\\'t General Hill lead the attack ?                              Say again ?                              Shouldn\\'t General Hill lead the attack ?                              My apologies, sir .                              I\\'ve always been very cautious .                              Very cautious .                              There is no one I trust more .                              If we can take that ridge . . .                              We can . And we will .                              General, God go with you .                              George, you are leading attack .                              Now get ready, George .                              Take your men behind the line of trees .  I\\'ll give you details later .                              Now, move, George !                              Forgive me the torn trousers, sir .  An officer riding around like this .                              Colonel Alexander .                              Those federal cannon up on that  little rocky hill can cause some trouble .                              I want you to assign some guns  and keep them silent .                              Then . . .                              you move forward  when the infantry advance . . .                              keeping the flanks clear .                              Porter, how old are you, son ?                              Sir, I\\'m    sir .                              Porter, we must also clear those guns  off that low center ridge right there .                              - That is the main thing .  - Yes, sir .                              - I\\'m relying on you, son .  - Yes, sir . I\\'ll sure keep them shooting .                              Good .                              I want you to use everything you have .                              Maximum effort .  Fire all long-range ordinance .                              But don\\'t open up till I give the word  and everything\\'s in position .                              Then fire with all you\\'ve got .  I don\\'t want to see a single gun silent .                              Find an observation point  and check the damage .                              We must clear those people off that ridge .                              If we don\\'t . . .                              Anyway, you let me know when you\\'re  nearing the end of your ammunition .                              We must conserve enough to support  the infantry attack . Is that clear ?                              Yes, sir .                              Johnston Pettigrew,  University of North Carolina .                              Yeah, I know .                              They still talk about your grades there  with reverence and awe .                              Your reputation as a scholar  has preceded you, sir .                              I hear you\\'ve written a book .                              It was only a minor work .  If the general would care to read it . . .                              - Surely .  - Take a copy with my compliments .                              Captain, retrieve my book  from the baggage .                              General, my apologies, but I do not believe  I will have time to read that today .                              Gentlemen .                              I want you to look  at that clump of trees on that ridge .                              That is where all units will converge .                              You will be spread out in a long line,  perhaps a mile, about       men .                              All units converging on that point  on the crest of that ridge .                              Now, look here .                              The Yankee center . A stone wall .                              A small grove of trees .                              General Trimble, commanding  Pender\\'s division, will be on the left .                              Pettigrew\\'s brigade in support .                              General Pickett\\'s division  will be on the right side of the attack .                              And now, George,  I want you to put two brigades in front . . .                              and one in back, like so .                              Yes, sir .                              Garnett\\'s brigade .                              That\\'s Jimmy Kemper .                              Armistead\\'s in support .                              Good . All right, then .                              Garnett will dress off at Trimble\\'s flank .                              And he will be the hinge, so to speak,  in a series of left obliques .                              Somewhere about  the Emmitsburgh Road . . .                              you will execute your first left oblique .                              Then direct .                              Then left again .                              And so on at your own discretion . . .                              in order to deceive the Yankees  and spread them out in a long line .                              Here . Any questions ?                              All right, gentlemen .                              That is the conversion point .  That clump of trees .                              We will use all of the artillery .                              And it will center on the point, right there .                              We\\'ll fire every gun they have  until the ammunition runs out .                              When that is done,  I will give the order and you all go in .                              I do believe this attack will decide  the fate of our country .                              All the men who have died in the past  are with you here today .                              I want to say, sir, it is an honor to serve  under your command .                              I want to thank you, sir, for giving me  the opportunity of serving here .                              I have prayed, sir .                              Can you take that ridge ?                              Harrison .                              Would you mind giving someone an order  to give me a musket ?                              I think today I\\'d like to join the attack .                              If I could even borrow a hat from a soldier  or just a jacket with some stripes on it .                              Sir, just once .                              Because I think, sir,  today might be the last day .                              Haven\\'t I earned it, sir ?                              You know what\\'s going to happen ?                              I\\'ll tell you what\\'s going to happen .                              Troops are now forming  behind the line of trees .                              When they come out, they will be under  enemy long-range artillery fire .                              Solid shot . Percussion .  Every gun they have .                              Troops will come out under fire  with more than a mile to walk .                              And still, within the open field . . .                              among the range of aimed muskets .                              They\\'ll be slowed down  by that fence out there .                              And the formation, what\\'s left of it,  will begin to come apart .                              When they cross that road,  they\\'ll be under short-range artillery .                              Canister fire .                              Thousands of little bits of shrapnel  wiping the holes in the lines .                              If they get to that wall  without breaking up . . .                              there won\\'t be many left .                              A mathematical equation .                              But maybe, just maybe . . .                              our own artillery will break up  their defenses .                              There\\'s always that hope .                              That\\'s Hancock out there .  And he isn\\'t going to run .                              So it\\'s mathematical after all .                              If they get to that road, or beyond it,  we\\'ll suffer over    percent casualties .                              But, Harrison . . .                              I don\\'t believe my boys will reach  that wall .                              Sir, with your permission .                              I\\'ll get myself that musket, sir .                              That\\'s General Meade\\'s headquarters .                              You\\'re to take a position in reserve .                              You don\\'t have to entrench,  but please don\\'t go away .                              - Major Spear, do you have that ?  - Yes, sir . I\\'ll place the men .                              You, sir, are to report to General Hancock .  If you will follow me .                              General Hancock, sir .  Colonel Chamberlain,   th Maine .                              Chamberlain .                              Yes .                              I hear from the ranks that  you may have been more involved . . .                              than anyone in staff has told me .                              We were involved .                              They tell me  you ordered a bayonet charge .                              It\\'s nothing to be ashamed of,  I might tell you .                              I\\'m going to look into it .                              We need fighting men in this army .                              And one damn thing is sure,  we\\'ll need some brigade commanders .                              Meanwhile, well done . Well done .                              Thank you, sir .                              How\\'s your outfit ?                              We need provisions .  The men need a meal . And ammunition .                              We\\'re out .                              See to Colonel Chamberlain\\'s request .                              I want you to write a report .                              Yes, sir .                              They say you are a schoolteacher .                              That seems like a long time ago .                              Sometimes I\\'m not sure  how long I\\'ve been in this war .                              Three years or three lifetimes .                              - What do you teach ?  - Rhetoric . . .                              and Natural and Revealed Religion .  At Bowdoin College, sir .                              Now you tell me, Professor .                              Can you recall a story from antiquity  where two men . . .                              who are best of friends, almost brothers . . .                              where these men find themselves,  by a trick of fate . . .                              on opposing sides in a great war ?                              Then, on a given day . . .                              find themselves facing one another  on the very same battlefield ?                              If the Greeks did not tell of such a story,  surely the Romans did .                              But, sir, I think it must be found  in the Bible .                              There isn\\'t an officer on either side . . .                              who hasn\\'t know someone wearing  the other uniform . I know that .                              But this morning . . .                              I looked through my glass  and saw the colors . . .                              of the  th and   th Virginia regiments  on those ridges before us . . .                              directly facing us, right over there .                              It was as if I could hear his voice .                              See his old crumpled hat .                              Armistead commands one of Pickett\\'s  brigades and he\\'s out there for sure .                              I somehow thought this day  would never come .                              I thought the war would be over  in a month .                              It\\'s three years and how many more ?                              Who could\\'ve dreamed  it could go on for so long ?                              What would you do, Chamberlain ?                              What do the books tell you to do ?                              Now you go and rest up .                              Nothing\\'s going to happen today anyway .                              Everybody\\'s too tired, too hot,  too worn out . Both sides .                              We\\'re placed in reserve, just over there .                              Thank you for your sentiments, sir .                              I just got back from the hospital .                              God-awful mess .                              They got no room .                              They got no shade .  They got men lying everywhere .                              They\\'re cutting off arms and legs  in front of everybody .                              They ought to not do that in public .                              Men ought to have some privacy  at a time like that .                              You see Kilrain ?                              How is he ?                              He died .                              He died this morning before I got there .                              A couple of fellows were with him .                              He said to tell you goodbye .                              And that he was sorry .                              I tell you, Lawrence .                              I sure was fond of that man .                              General, please get down .  We cannot spare you .                              There are times when  a corps commander\\'s life does not count .                              How are you, Lo ?                              I\\'m fine, Dick .                              Well, that\\'s good .                              How\\'s the leg ?                              It\\'s all right .                              Can\\'t walk .                              I\\'ll have to ride .                              You can\\'t do that .  You\\'ll be the perfect target .                              We\\'re going up there today  and we\\'re going to break that line .                              When the Yankees run away, there\\'ll be  an open road all the way to Washington .                              And maybe we\\'ll win it today .                              And today will be the last day .                              Maybe today .                              I\\'ve got to ride up there .                              Well, Lo .                              I\\'ll see you at the top .                              My God, Lo . Isn\\'t it marvelous ?                              I thought we missed it all .                              - Any questions ?  - No .                              All right, then .                              When the firing ceases,  we step out real quick .                              No halting, no stopping to fire .  We want to get there quick as we can .                              What about Garnett ?                              - What about him ?  - He can\\'t hardly walk .                              Damnation .                              George, order him not to make the charge .                              General Armistead, how can I do that ?                              General Armistead, sir .                              My compliments .                              I hope Her Majesty\\'s emissary  passed a comfortable night .                              Slept like the dead, sir .                              A baby . Slept like a newborn baby, sir .                              Lie still, men . Keep down .                              There\\'s no safe place here .                              One spot\\'s as good as the next .                              We\\'ve been firing for a good while, sir .                              It\\'s apparent neither the federals nor we  are going to gain a clear advantage .                              If we continue to expend our ammunition  at this rate . . .                              we may endanger our ability  to support the advance .                              Did you not have enough ordinance  when this was begun ?                              The federal fire compelled us to remove  the artillery train farther to the rear .                              It\\'s taking us longer to refill the caissons .                              Sir, we must slow down our fire now . . .                              or we will have to cut back on the guns  sent in to support the infantry .                              Damn !                              I\\'ll have to order General Pickett to halt  his attack until the guns get replenished .                              The trains have a little ammunition .  It\\'ll take an hour to redistribute it .                              In the meanwhile,  the enemy would impound the top .                              The more we delay . . .                              the more time the federals have  to strengthen their own lines .                              And even if we recover more supplies  from the ordinance train . . .                              how much more damage can we inflict  on them than they on us ?                              They\\'re bringing in fresh batteries  as quickly as we drive them off .                              Just get some more ammunition  and keep it hot .                              I can\\'t send Pickett\\'s division  or the others . . .                              until we clear some of those guns  off that ridge .                              I\\'m told you are descended  from an illustrious military family .                              Who told you that ? Kemper ?                              He tells me it was your uncle  who defended Fort McHenry . . .                              during the War of      .                              And that he was therefore the guardian  of the original \"Star-Spangled Banner\" .                              I must say,  I do appreciate the irony of it all .                              Colonel Fremantle .                              It does not begin or end with my uncle  or myself .                              We\\'re all sons of Virginia here .                              That major out there  commanding the cannon:                              That\\'s James Dearing .                              First in his class at West Point,  before Virginia seceded .                              And the boy over there  with the color guard .                              That\\'s Private Robert Tyler Jones .                              His grandfather was  President of the United States .                              The colonel behind me,  that\\'s Colonel William Aylett .                              Now, his great grandfather . . .                              was the Virginian Patrick Henry .                              It was Patrick Henry  who said to your King George IIl:                              \"Give me liberty or give me death .\"                              There are boys here from . . .                              Norfolk .                              Portsmouth .                              Small hamlets along the James River .                              From Charlottesville and Fredericksburg .                              The Shenandoah Valley .                              Mostly they\\'re all veteran soldiers now .                              The cowards and shirkers are long gone .                              Every man here knows his duty .                              They would make this charge  even without an officer to lead them .                              They know the gravity of the situation .                              And the mettle of their foe .                              They know that this day\\'s work . . .                              will be desperate and deadly .                              They know that for many of them . . .                              this will be their last charge .                              But not one of them needs to be told  what is expected of him .                              They are all willing to make  the supreme sacrifice . . .                              to achieve victory here .                              The crowning victory  and the end of this war .                              We are all here .                              You may tell them  when you return to your country . . .                              that all Virginia was here on this day .                              A message from Alexander .                              \"Hurry up, for God\\'s sake,  or the artillery can\\'t help you .\"                              Your order, sir ?

You may reform to the rear of this ridge  and set up a defensive position .                              General Pickett, sir .  You must look to your division .                              General Lee .                              I have no division .                              General . . .

If we can reach the Potomac . . .                              and cross over into Virginia . . .                              there will be no more immediate danger .

General ?                              We must look to our own deportment .                              The spirit of the army is still very good .  Very good indeed .                              We will do better another time .                              They do not die for us . Not for us .                              That at least is a blessing .

for to supply her loss , he invited and received into his house the family of his nephew mr. henry dashwood , the legal inheritor of the norland estate , and the person to whom he intended to bequeath it . </s>', \"<s> in the society of his nephew and niece , and their children , the old gentleman 's days were comfortably spent . </s>\", '<s> his attachment to them all increased . </s>', '<s> the constant attention of mr. and mrs. henry dashwood to his wishes , which proceeded not merely from interest , but from goodness of heart , gave him every degree of solid comfort which his age could receive ; and the cheerfulness of the children added a relish to his existence . </s>', '<s> by a former marriage , mr. henry dashwood had one son : by his present lady , three daughters . </s>', '<s> the son , a steady respectable young man , was amply provided for by the fortune of his mother , which had been large , and half of which devolved on him on his coming of age . </s>', '<s> by his own marriage , likewise , which happened soon afterwards , he added to his wealth . </s>', \"<s> to him therefore the succession to the norland estate was not so really important as to his sisters ; for their fortune , independent of what might arise to them from their father 's inheriting that property , could be but small . </s>\", \"<s> their mother had nothing , and their father only seven thousand pounds in his own disposal ; for the remaining moiety of his first wife 's fortune was also secured to her child , and he had only a life - interest in it . </s>\", '<s> the old gentleman died : his will was read , and like almost every other will , gave as much disappointment as pleasure . </s>', '<s> he was neither so unjust , nor so ungrateful , as to leave his estate from his nephew ; but he left it to him on such terms as destroyed half the value of the bequest . </s>', \"<s> mr. dashwood had wished for it more for the sake of his wife and daughters than for himself or his son ; but to his son , and his son 's son , a child of four years old , it was secured , in such a way , as to leave to himself no power of providing for those who were most dear to him , and who most needed a provision by any charge on the estate , or by any sale of its valuable woods . </s>\", '<s> the whole was tied up for the benefit of this child , who , in occasional visits with his father and mother at norland , had so far gained on the affections of his uncle , by such attractions as are by no means unusual in children of two or three years old ; an imperfect articulation , an earnest desire of having his own way , many cunning tricks , and a great deal of noise , as to outweigh all the value of all the attention which , for years , he had received from his niece and her daughters . </s>', '<s> he meant not to be unkind , however , and , as a mark of his affection for the three girls , he left them a thousand pounds a - piece . </s>', \"<s> mr. dashwood 's disappointment was , at first , severe ; but his temper was cheerful and sanguine ; and he might reasonably hope to live many years , and by living economically , lay by a considerable sum from the produce of an estate already large , and capable of almost immediate improvement . </s>\", '<s> but the fortune , which had been so tardy in coming , was his only one twelvemonth . </s>', '<s> he survived his uncle no longer ; and ten thousand pounds , including the late legacies , was all that remained for his widow and daughters . </s>', '<s> his son was sent for as soon as his danger was known , and to him mr. dashwood recommended , with all the strength and urgency which illness could command , the interest of his mother - in - law and sisters . </s>', '<s> mr. john dashwood had not the strong feelings of the rest of the family ; but he was affected by a recommendation of such a nature at such a time , and he promised to do every thing in his power to make them comfortable . </s>', '<s> his father was rendered easy by such an assurance , and mr. john dashwood had then leisure to consider how much there might prudently be in his power to do for them . </s>', \"<s> [ illustration : _ his son 's son , a child of four years old . _ ] </s>\", '<s> he was not an ill - disposed young man , unless to be rather cold hearted and rather selfish is to be ill - disposed : but he was , in general , well respected ; for he conducted himself with propriety in the discharge of his ordinary duties . </s>', '<s> had he married a more amiable woman , he might have been made still more respectable than he was : he might even have been made amiable himself ; for he was very young when he married , and very fond of his wife . </s>', '<s> but mrs. john dashwood was a strong caricature of himself ; more narrow - minded and selfish . </s>', '<s> when he gave his promise to his father , he meditated within himself to increase the fortunes of his sisters by the present of a thousand pounds a - piece . </s>', '<s> he then really thought himself equal to it . </s>', \"<s> the prospect of four thousand a - year , in addition to his present income , besides the remaining half of his own mother 's fortune , warmed his heart , and made him feel capable of generosity . </s>\", '<s> yes , he would give them three thousand pounds : it would be liberal and handsome ! </s>', '<s> it would be enough to make them completely easy . </s>', '<s> three thousand pounds ! </s>', '<s> he could spare so considerable a sum with little inconvenience . </s>', '<s> he thought of it all day long , and for many days successively , and he did not repent . </s>', \"<s> no sooner was his father 's funeral over , than mrs. john dashwood , without sending any notice of her intention to her mother - in - law , arrived with her child and their attendants . </s>\", \"<s> no one could dispute her right to come ; the house was her husband 's from the moment of his father 's decease ; but the indelicacy of her conduct was so much the greater , and to a woman in mrs. dashwood 's situation , with only common feelings , must have been highly unpleasing . </s>\", '<s> but in _ her _ mind there was a sense of honor so keen , a generosity so romantic , that any offence of the kind , by whomsoever given or received , was to her a source of immovable disgust . </s>', \"<s> mrs. john dashwood had never been a favourite with any of her husband 's family ; but she had had no opportunity , till the present , of showing them with how little attention to the comfort of other people she could act when occasion required it . </s>\", '<s> so acutely did mrs. dashwood feel this ungracious behaviour , and so earnestly did she despise her daughter - in - law for it , that , on the arrival of the latter , she would have quitted the house for ever , had not the entreaty of her eldest girl induced her first to reflect on the propriety of going , and her own tender love for all her three children determined her afterwards to stay , and for their sakes avoid a breach with their brother . </s>', '<s> elinor , this eldest daughter , whose advice was so effectual , possessed a strength of understanding , and coolness of judgment , which qualified her , though only nineteen , to be the counsellor of her mother , and enabled her frequently to counteract , to the advantage of them all , that eagerness of mind in mrs. dashwood which must generally have led to imprudence . </s>', '<s> she had an excellent heart ; her disposition was affectionate , and her feelings were strong ; but she knew how to govern them : it was a knowledge which her mother had yet to learn ; and which one of her sisters had resolved never to be taught . </s>', \"<s> marianne 's abilities were , in many respects , quite equal to elinor 's . </s>\", '<s> she was sensible and clever ; but eager in everything : her sorrows , her joys , could have no moderation . </s>', '<s> she was generous , amiable , interesting : she was everything but prudent . </s>', '<s> the resemblance between her and her mother was strikingly great . </s>', \"<s> elinor saw , with concern , the excess of her sister 's sensibility ; but by mrs. dashwood it was valued and cherished . </s>\", '<s> they encouraged each other now in the violence of their affliction . </s>', '<s> the agony of grief which overpowered them at first , was voluntarily renewed , was sought for , was created again and again . </s>', '<s> they gave themselves up wholly to their sorrow , seeking increase of wretchedness in every reflection that could afford it , and resolved against ever admitting consolation in future . </s>', '<s> elinor , too , was deeply afflicted ; but still she could struggle , she could exert herself . </s>', '<s> she could consult with her brother , could receive her sister - in - law on her arrival , and treat her with proper attention ; and could strive to rouse her mother to similar exertion , and encourage her to similar forbearance . </s>', \"<s> margaret , the other sister , was a good - humored , well - disposed girl ; but as she had already imbibed a good deal of marianne 's romance , without having much of her sense , she did not , at thirteen , bid fair to equal her sisters at a more advanced period of life . </s>\", '<s> mrs. john dashwood now installed herself mistress of norland ; and her mother and sisters - in - law were degraded to the condition of visitors . </s>', '<s> as such , however , they were treated by her with quiet civility ; and by her husband with as much kindness as he could feel towards anybody beyond himself , his wife , and their child . </s>', '<s> he really pressed them , with some earnestness , to consider norland as their home ; and , as no plan appeared so eligible to mrs. dashwood as remaining there till she could accommodate herself with a house in the neighbourhood , his invitation was accepted . </s>', '<s> a continuance in a place where everything reminded her of former delight , was exactly what suited her mind . </s>', '<s> in seasons of cheerfulness , no temper could be more cheerful than hers , or possess , in a greater degree , that sanguine expectation of happiness which is happiness itself . </s>', '<s> but in sorrow she must be equally carried away by her fancy , and as far beyond consolation as in pleasure she was beyond alloy . </s>', '<s> mrs. john dashwood did not at all approve of what her husband intended to do for his sisters . </s>', '<s> to take three thousand pounds from the fortune of their dear little boy would be impoverishing him to the most dreadful degree . </s>', '<s> she begged him to think again on the subject . </s>', '<s> how could he answer it to himself to rob his child , and his only child too , of so large a sum ? </s>', '<s> and what possible claim could the miss dashwoods , who were related to him only by half blood , which she considered as no relationship at all , have on his generosity to so large an amount . </s>', '<s> it was very well known that no affection was ever supposed to exist between the children of any man by different marriages ; and why was he to ruin himself , and their poor little harry , by giving away all his money to his half sisters ? </s>', '<s> \" it was my father \\'s last request to me , \" replied her husband , \" that i should assist his widow and daughters . \" </s>', '<s> \" he did not know what he was talking of , i dare say ; ten to one </s>', '<s> but he was light - headed at the time . </s>', '<s> had he been in his right senses , he could not have thought of such a thing as begging you to give away half your fortune from your own child . \" </s>', '<s> \" he did not stipulate for any particular sum , my dear fanny ; he only requested me , in general terms , to assist them , and make their situation more comfortable than it was in his power to do . </s>', '<s> perhaps it would have been as well if he had left it wholly to myself . </s>', '<s> he could hardly suppose i should neglect them . </s>', '<s> but as he required the promise , i could not do less than give it ; at least i thought so at the time . </s>', '<s> the promise , therefore , was given , and must be performed . </s>', '<s> something must be done for them whenever they leave norland and settle in a new home . \" </s>', '<s> \" well , then , _ let _ something be done for them ; but _ that _ something need not be three thousand pounds . </s>', '<s> consider , \" she added , \" that when the money is once parted with , it never can return . </s>', '<s> your sisters will marry , and it will be gone for ever . </s>', '<s> if , indeed , it could be restored to our poor little boy-- \" </s>', '<s> \" why , to be sure , \" said her husband , very gravely , \" that would make great difference . </s>', '<s> the time may come when harry will regret that so large a sum was parted with . </s>', '<s> if he should have a numerous family , for instance , it would be a very convenient addition . \" </s>', '<s> \" to be sure it would . \" </s>', '<s> \" perhaps , then , it would be better for all parties , if the sum were diminished one half . </s>', '<s> five hundred pounds would be a prodigious increase to their fortunes ! \" </s>', '<s> \" oh ! beyond anything great ! </s>', '<s> what brother on earth would do half so much for his sisters , even if _ really _ his sisters ! </s>', '<s> and as it is -- only half blood ! </s>', '<s> but you have such a generous spirit ! \" </s>', '<s> \" i would not wish to do any thing mean , \" he replied . </s>', '<s> \" one had rather , on such occasions , do too much than too little . </s>', '<s> no one , at least , can think i have not done enough for them : even themselves , they can hardly expect more . \" </s>', '<s> \" there is no knowing what _ they _ may expect , \" said the lady , \" but we are not to think of their expectations : the question is , what you can afford to do . \" </s>', '<s> \" certainly ; and i think i may afford to give them five hundred pounds a - piece . </s>', '<s> as it is , without any addition of mine , they will each have about three thousand pounds on their mother \\'s death -- a very comfortable fortune for any young woman . \" </s>', '<s> \" to be sure it is ;

her life can not be worth half that purchase . \" </s>', '<s> \" certainly not ; but if you observe , people always live for ever when there is an annuity to be paid them ; and she is very stout and healthy , and hardly forty . </s>', '<s> an annuity is a very serious business ; it comes over and over every year , and there is no getting rid of it . </s>', '<s> you are not aware of what you are doing . </s>', \"<s> i have known a great deal of the trouble of annuities ; for my mother was clogged with the payment of three to old superannuated servants by my father 's will , and it is amazing how disagreeable she found it . </s>\", '<s> twice every year these annuities were to be paid ; and then there was the trouble of getting it to them ; and then one of them was said to have died , and afterwards it turned out to be no such thing . </s>', '<s> my mother was quite sick of it . </s>', \"<s> her income was not her own , she said , with such perpetual claims on it ; and it was the more unkind in my father , because , otherwise , the money would have been entirely at my mother 's disposal , without any restriction whatever . </s>\", '<s> it has given me such an abhorrence of annuities , that i am sure i would not pin myself down to the payment of one for all the world . \" </s>', '<s> \" it is certainly an unpleasant thing , \" replied mr. dashwood , \" to have those kind of yearly drains on one \\'s income . </s>', \"<s> one 's fortune , as your mother justly says , is _ not _ one 's own . </s>\", '<s> to be tied down to the regular payment of such a sum , on every rent day , is by no means desirable : it takes away one \\'s independence . \" </s>', '<s> \" undoubtedly ; and after all you have no thanks for it . </s>', '<s> they think themselves secure , you do no more than what is expected , and it raises no gratitude at all . </s>', '<s> if i were you , whatever i did should be done at my own discretion entirely . </s>', '<s> i would not bind myself to allow them any thing yearly . </s>', '<s> it may be very inconvenient some years to spare a hundred , or even fifty pounds from our own expenses . \" </s>', '<s> \" i believe you are right , my love ; it will be better that there should be no annuity in the case ; whatever i may give them occasionally will be of far greater assistance than a yearly allowance , because they would only enlarge their style of living if they felt sure of a larger income , and would not be sixpence the richer for it at the end of the year . </s>', '<s> it will certainly be much the best way . </s>', '<s> a present of fifty pounds , now and then , will prevent their ever being distressed for money , and will , i think , be amply discharging my promise to my father . \" </s>', '<s> \" to be sure it will . </s>', '<s> indeed , to say the truth , i am convinced within myself that your father had no idea of your giving them any money at all . </s>', '<s> the assistance he thought of , i dare say , was only such as might be reasonably expected of you ; for instance , such as looking out for a comfortable small house for them , helping them to move their things , and sending them presents of fish and game , and so forth , whenever they are in season . </s>', \"<s> i 'll lay my life that he meant nothing farther ;

and he finally resolved , that it would be absolutely unnecessary , if not highly indecorous , to do more for the widow and children of his father , than such kind of neighbourly acts as his own wife pointed out . </s>', '<s> mrs. dashwood remained at norland several months ; not from any disinclination to move when the sight of every well known spot ceased to raise the violent emotion which it produced for a while ; for when her spirits began to revive , and her mind became capable of some other exertion than that of heightening its affliction by melancholy remembrances , she was impatient to be gone , and indefatigable in her inquiries for a suitable dwelling in the neighbourhood of norland ; for to remove far from that beloved spot was impossible . </s>', '<s> but she could hear of no situation that at once answered her notions of comfort and ease , and suited the prudence of her eldest daughter , whose steadier judgment rejected several houses as too large for their income , which her mother would have approved . </s>', '<s> [ illustration : \" _ i can not imagine how they will spend half of it . _ \" ] </s>', '<s> mrs. dashwood had been informed by her husband of the solemn promise on the part of his son in their favour , which gave comfort to his last earthly reflections . </s>', \"<s> she doubted the sincerity of this assurance no more than he had doubted it himself , and she thought of it for her daughters ' sake with satisfaction , though as for herself she was persuaded that a much smaller provision than 7000l would support her in affluence . </s>\", \"<s> for their brother 's sake , too , for the sake of his own heart , she rejoiced ; and she reproached herself for being unjust to his merit before , in believing him incapable of generosity . </s>\", '<s> his attentive behaviour to herself and his sisters convinced her that their welfare was dear to him , and , for a long time , she firmly relied on the liberality of his intentions . </s>', \"<s> the contempt which she had , very early in their acquaintance , felt for her daughter - in - law , was very much increased by the farther knowledge of her character , which half a year 's residence in her family afforded ; and perhaps in spite of every consideration of politeness or maternal affection on the side of the former , the two ladies might have found it impossible to have lived together so long , had not a particular circumstance occurred to give still greater eligibility , according to the opinions of mrs. dashwood , to her daughters ' continuance at norland . </s>\", \"<s> this circumstance was a growing attachment between her eldest girl and the brother of mrs. john dashwood , a gentlemanlike and pleasing young man , who was introduced to their acquaintance soon after his sister 's establishment at norland , and who had since spent the greatest part of his time there . </s>\", '<s> some mothers might have encouraged the intimacy from motives of interest , for edward ferrars was the eldest son of a man who had died very rich ;

and sometimes , for a few painful minutes , she believed it to be no more than friendship . </s>', '<s> but , whatever might really be its limits , it was enough , when perceived by his sister , to make her uneasy , and at the same time , ( which was still more common , ) to make her uncivil . </s>', \"<s> she took the first opportunity of affronting her mother - in - law on the occasion , talking to her so expressively of her brother 's great expectations , of mrs. ferrars 's resolution that both her sons should marry well , and of the danger attending any young woman who attempted to _ draw him in _ , that mrs. dashwood could neither pretend to be unconscious , nor endeavor to be calm . </s>\", '<s> she gave her an answer which marked her contempt , and instantly left the room , resolving that , whatever might be the inconvenience or expense of so sudden a removal , her beloved elinor should not be exposed another week to such insinuations . </s>', '<s> in this state of her spirits , a letter was delivered to her from the post , which contained a proposal particularly well timed . </s>', '<s> it was the offer of a small house , on very easy terms , belonging to a relation of her own , a gentleman of consequence and property in devonshire . </s>', '<s> the letter was from this gentleman himself , and written in the true spirit of friendly accommodation . </s>', '<s> he understood that she was in need of a dwelling ; and though the house he now offered her was merely a cottage , he assured her that everything should be done to it which she might think necessary , if the situation pleased her . </s>', '<s> he earnestly pressed her , after giving the particulars of the house and garden , to come with her daughters to barton park , the place of his own residence , from whence she might judge , herself , whether barton cottage , for the houses were in the same parish , could , by any alteration , be made comfortable to her . </s>', '<s> he seemed really anxious to accommodate them and the whole of his letter was written in so friendly a style as could not fail of giving pleasure to his cousin ; more especially at a moment when she was suffering under the cold and unfeeling behaviour of her nearer connections . </s>', '<s> she needed no time for deliberation or inquiry . </s>', '<s> her resolution was formed as she read . </s>', '<s> the situation of barton , in a county so far distant from sussex as devonshire , which , but a few hours before , would have been a sufficient objection to outweigh every possible advantage belonging to the place , was now its first recommendation . </s>', \"<s> to quit the neighbourhood of norland was no longer an evil ; it was an object of desire ; it was a blessing , in comparison of the misery of continuing her daughter - in - law 's guest ; and to remove for ever from that beloved place would be less painful than to inhabit or visit it while such a woman was its mistress . </s>\", '<s> she instantly wrote sir john middleton her acknowledgment of his kindness , and her acceptance of his proposal ; and then hastened to show both letters to her daughters , that she might be secure of their approbation before her answer were sent . </s>', '<s> elinor had always thought it would be more prudent for them to settle at some distance from norland , than immediately amongst their present acquaintance . </s>', \"<s> on _ that _ head , therefore , it was not for her to oppose her mother 's intention of removing into devonshire . </s>\", '<s> the house , too , as described by sir john , was on so simple a scale , and the rent so uncommonly moderate , as to leave her no right of objection on either point ; and , therefore , though it was not a plan which brought any charm to her fancy , though it was a removal from the vicinity of norland beyond her wishes , she made no attempt to dissuade her mother from sending a letter of acquiescence . </s>', '<s> no sooner was her answer dispatched , than mrs. dashwood indulged herself in the pleasure of announcing to her son - in - law and his wife that she was provided with a house , and should incommode them no longer than till every thing were ready for her inhabiting it . </s>', '<s> they heard her with surprise . </s>', '<s> mrs. john dashwood said nothing ; but her husband civilly hoped that she would not be settled far from norland . </s>', '<s> she had great satisfaction in replying that she was going into devonshire . </s>', '<s> edward turned hastily towards her , on hearing this , and , in a voice of surprise and concern , which required no explanation to her , repeated , \" devonshire ! </s>', '<s> are you , indeed , going there ? </s>', '<s> so far from hence ! </s>', '<s> and to what part of it ? \" </s>', '<s> she explained the situation . </s>', '<s> it was within four miles northward of exeter . </s>', '<s> \" it is but a cottage , \" she continued , \" but i hope to see many of my friends in it . </s>', '<s> a room or two can easily be added ;

and to edward she gave one with still greater affection . </s>', '<s> though her late conversation with her daughter - in - law had made her resolve on remaining at norland no longer than was unavoidable , it had not produced the smallest effect on her in that point to which it principally tended . </s>', '<s> to separate edward and elinor was as far from being her object as ever ; and she wished to show mrs. john dashwood , by this pointed invitation to her brother , how totally she disregarded her disapprobation of the match . </s>', '<s> mr. john dashwood told his mother again and again how exceedingly sorry he was that she had taken a house at such a distance from norland as to prevent his being of any service to her in removing her furniture . </s>', '<s> he really felt conscientiously vexed on the occasion ; for the very exertion to which he had limited the performance of his promise to his father was by this arrangement rendered impracticable . </s>', '<s> the furniture was all sent around by water . </s>', \"<s> it chiefly consisted of household linen , plate , china , and books , with a handsome pianoforte of marianne 's . </s>\", \"<s> mrs. john dashwood saw the packages depart with a sigh : she could not help feeling it hard that as mrs. dashwood 's income would be so trifling in comparison with their own , she should have any handsome article of furniture . </s>\", '<s> mrs. dashwood took the house for a twelvemonth ; it was ready furnished , and she might have immediate possession . </s>', '<s> no difficulty arose on either side in the agreement ; and she waited only for the disposal of her effects at norland , and to determine her future household , before she set off for the west ; and this , as she was exceedingly rapid in the performance of everything that interested her , was soon done . </s>', '<s> the horses which were left her by her husband had been sold soon after his death , and an opportunity now offering of disposing of her carriage , she agreed to sell that likewise at the earnest advice of her eldest daughter . </s>', '<s> for the comfort of her children , had she consulted only her own wishes , she would have kept it ; but the discretion of elinor prevailed . </s>', '<s> _ her _ wisdom too limited the number of their servants to three ; two maids and a man , with whom they were speedily provided from amongst those who had formed their establishment at norland . </s>', \"<s> the man and one of the maids were sent off immediately into devonshire , to prepare the house for their mistress 's arrival ; for as lady middleton was entirely unknown to mrs. dashwood , she preferred going directly to the cottage to being a visitor at barton park ; and she relied so undoubtingly on sir john 's description of the house , as to feel no curiosity to examine it herself till she entered it as her own . </s>\", '<s> her eagerness to be gone from norland was preserved from diminution by the evident satisfaction of her daughter - in - law in the prospect of her removal ; a satisfaction which was but feebly attempted to be concealed under a cold invitation to her to defer her departure . </s>', \"<s> now was the time when her son - in - law 's promise to his father might with particular propriety be fulfilled . </s>\", '<s> since he had neglected to do it on first coming to the estate , their quitting his house might be looked on as the most suitable period for its accomplishment . </s>', '<s> but mrs. dashwood began shortly to give over every hope of the kind , and to be convinced , from the general drift of his discourse , that his assistance extended no farther than their maintenance for six months at norland . </s>', '<s> he so frequently talked of the increasing expenses of housekeeping , and of the perpetual demands upon his purse , which a man of any consequence in the world was beyond calculation exposed to , that he seemed rather to stand in need of more money himself than to have any design of giving money away . </s>', \"<s> in a very few weeks from the day which brought sir john middleton 's first letter to norland , every thing was so far settled in their future abode as to enable mrs. dashwood and her daughters to begin their journey . </s>\", '<s> many were the tears shed by them in their last adieus to a place so much beloved . </s>', '<s> \" dear , dear norland ! \" said marianne , as she wandered alone before the house , on the last evening of their being there ;

and beyond them were the offices and the stairs . </s>', '<s> four bedrooms and two garrets formed the rest of the house . </s>', '<s> it had not been built many years and was in good repair . </s>', '<s> in comparison of norland , it was poor and small indeed!--but the tears which recollection called forth as they entered the house were soon dried away . </s>', '<s> they were cheered by the joy of the servants on their arrival , and each for the sake of the others resolved to appear happy . </s>', '<s> it was very early in september ; the season was fine , and from first seeing the place under the advantage of good weather , they received an impression in its favour which was of material service in recommending it to their lasting approbation . </s>', '<s> the situation of the house was good . </s>', '<s> high hills rose immediately behind , and at no great distance on each side ; some of which were open downs , the others cultivated and woody . </s>', '<s> the village of barton was chiefly on one of these hills , and formed a pleasant view from the cottage windows . </s>', '<s> the prospect in front was more extensive ; it commanded the whole of the valley , and reached into the country beyond . </s>', '<s> the hills which surrounded the cottage terminated the valley in that direction ; under another name , and in another course , it branched out again between two of the steepest of them . </s>', '<s> with the size and furniture of the house mrs. dashwood was upon the whole well satisfied ; for though her former style of life rendered many additions to the latter indispensable , yet to add and improve was a delight to her ; and she had at this time ready money enough to supply all that was wanted of greater elegance to the apartments . </s>', '<s> \" as for the house itself , to be sure , \" said she , \" it is too small for our family , but we will make ourselves tolerably comfortable for the present , as it is too late in the year for improvements . </s>', '<s> perhaps in the spring , if i have plenty of money , as i dare say i shall , we may think about building . </s>', '<s> these parlors are both too small for such parties of our friends as i hope to see often collected here ; and i have some thoughts of throwing the passage into one of them with perhaps a part of the other , and so leave the remainder of that other for an entrance ; this , with a new drawing room which may be easily added , and a bed - chamber and garret above , will make it a very snug little cottage . </s>', '<s> i could wish the stairs were handsome . </s>', '<s> but one must not expect every thing ; though i suppose it would be no difficult matter to widen them . </s>', '<s> i shall see how much i am before - hand with the world in the spring , and we will plan our improvements accordingly . \" </s>', '<s> in the mean time , till all these alterations could be made from the savings of an income of five hundred a - year by a woman who never saved in her life , they were wise enough to be contented with the house as it was ; and each of them was busy in arranging their particular concerns , and endeavoring , by placing around them books and other possessions , to form themselves a home . </s>', \"<s> marianne 's pianoforte was unpacked and properly disposed of ; and elinor 's drawings were affixed to the walls of their sitting room . </s>\", '<s> in such employments as these they were interrupted soon after breakfast the next day by the entrance of their landlord , who called to welcome them to barton , and to offer them every accommodation from his own house and garden in which theirs might at present be deficient . </s>', '<s> sir john middleton was a good looking man about forty . </s>', '<s> he had formerly visited at stanhill , but it was too long for his young cousins to remember him . </s>', '<s> his countenance was thoroughly good - humoured ; and his manners were as friendly as the style of his letter . </s>', '<s> their arrival seemed to afford him real satisfaction , and their comfort to be an object of real solicitude to him . </s>', '<s> he said much of his earnest desire of their living in the most sociable terms with his family , and pressed them so cordially to dine at barton park every day till they were better settled at home , that , though his entreaties were carried to a point of perseverance beyond civility , they could not give offence . </s>', '<s> his kindness was not confined to words ; for within an hour after he left them , a large basket full of garden stuff and fruit arrived from the park , which was followed before the end of the day by a present of game . </s>', '<s> he insisted , moreover , on conveying all their letters to and from the post for them , and would not be denied the satisfaction of sending them his newspaper every day . </s>', '<s> lady middleton had sent a very civil message by him , denoting her intention of waiting on mrs. dashwood as soon as she could be assured that her visit would be no inconvenience ; and as this message was answered by an invitation equally polite , her ladyship was introduced to them the next day . </s>', '<s> [ illustration : _ so shy before company . _ ] </s>', '<s> they were , of course , very anxious to see a person on whom so much of their comfort at barton must depend ; and the elegance of her appearance was favourable to their wishes . </s>', '<s> lady middleton was not more than six or seven and twenty ; her face was handsome , her figure tall and striking , and her address graceful . </s>', \"<s> her manners had all the elegance which her husband 's wanted . </s>\", '<s> but they would have been improved by some share of his frankness and warmth ; and her visit was long enough to detract something from their first admiration , by showing that , though perfectly well - bred , she was reserved , cold , and had nothing to say for herself beyond the most common - place inquiry or remark . </s>', '<s> conversation however was not wanted , for sir john was very chatty , and lady middleton had taken the wise precaution of bringing with her their eldest child , a fine little boy about six years old , by which means there was one subject always to be recurred to by the ladies in case of extremity , for they had to enquire his name and age , admire his beauty , and ask him questions which his mother answered for him , while he hung about her and held down his head , to the great surprise of her ladyship , who wondered at his being so shy before company , as he could make noise enough at home . </s>', '<s> on every formal visit a child ought to be of the party , by way of provision for discourse . </s>', '<s> in the present case it took up ten minutes to determine whether the boy were most like his father or mother , and in what particular he resembled either , for of course every body differed , and every body was astonished at the opinion of the others . </s>', '<s> an opportunity was soon to be given to the dashwoods of debating on the rest of the children , as sir john would not leave the house without securing their promise of dining at the park the next day . </s>', '<s> barton park was about half a mile from the cottage . </s>', '<s> the ladies had passed near it in their way along the valley , but it was screened from their view at home by the projection of a hill . </s>', '<s> the house was large and handsome ; and the middletons lived in a style of equal hospitality and elegance . </s>', \"<s> the former was for sir john 's gratification , the latter for that of his lady . </s>\", '<s> they were scarcely ever without some friends staying with them in the house , and they kept more company of every kind than any other family in the neighbourhood . </s>', '<s> it was necessary to the happiness of both ; for however dissimilar in temper and outward behaviour , they strongly resembled each other in that total want of talent and taste which confined their employments , unconnected with such as society produced , within a very narrow compass . </s>', '<s> sir john was a sportsman , lady middleton a mother . </s>', '<s> he hunted and shot , and she humoured her children ; and these were their only resources . </s>', \"<s> lady middleton had the advantage of being able to spoil her children all the year round , while sir john 's independent employments were in existence only half the time . </s>\", '<s> continual engagements at home and abroad , however , supplied all the deficiencies of nature and education ; supported the good spirits of sir john , and gave exercise to the good breeding of his wife . </s>', '<s> lady middleton piqued herself upon the elegance of her table , and of all her domestic arrangements ; and from this kind of vanity was her greatest enjoyment in any of their parties . </s>', \"<s> but sir john 's satisfaction in society was much more real ; he delighted in collecting about him more young people than his house would hold , and the noisier they were the better was he pleased . </s>\", '<s> he was a blessing to all the juvenile part of the neighbourhood , </s>', '<s> for in summer he was for ever forming parties to eat cold ham and chicken out of doors , and in winter his private balls were numerous enough for any young lady who was not suffering under the insatiable appetite of fifteen . </s>', '<s> the arrival of a new family in the country was always a matter of joy to him , and in every point of view he was charmed with the inhabitants he had now procured for his cottage at barton . </s>', '<s> the miss dashwoods were young , pretty , and unaffected . </s>', '<s> it was enough to secure his good opinion ; for to be unaffected was all that a pretty girl could want to make her mind as captivating as her person . </s>', '<s> the friendliness of his disposition made him happy in accommodating those , whose situation might be considered , in comparison with the past , as unfortunate . </s>', '<s> in showing kindness to his cousins therefore he had the real satisfaction of a good heart ; and in settling a family of females only in his cottage , he had all the satisfaction of a sportsman ; for a sportsman , though he esteems only those of his sex who are sportsmen likewise , is not often desirous of encouraging their taste by admitting them to a residence within his own manor . </s>', '<s> mrs. dashwood and her daughters were met at the door of the house by sir john , who welcomed them to barton park with unaffected sincerity ; and as he attended them to the drawing room repeated to the young ladies the concern which the same subject had drawn from him the day before , at being unable to get any smart young men to meet them . </s>', '<s> they would see , he said , only one gentleman there besides himself ; a particular friend who was staying at the park , but who was neither very young nor very gay . </s>', '<s> he hoped they would all excuse the smallness of the party , and could assure them it should never happen so again . </s>', '<s> he had been to several families that morning in hopes of procuring some addition to their number , but it was moonlight and every body was full of engagements . </s>', \"<s> luckily lady middleton 's mother had arrived at barton within the last hour , and as she was a very cheerful agreeable woman , he hoped the young ladies would not find it so very dull as they might imagine . </s>\", '<s> the young ladies , as well as their mother , were perfectly satisfied with having two entire strangers of the party , and wished for no more . </s>', \"<s> mrs. jennings , lady middleton 's mother , was a good - humoured , merry , fat , elderly woman , who talked a great deal , seemed very happy , and rather vulgar . </s>\", '<s> she was full of jokes and laughter , and before dinner was over had said many witty things on the subject of lovers and husbands ; hoped they had not left their hearts behind them in sussex , and pretended to see them blush whether they did or not . </s>', \"<s> marianne was vexed at it for her sister 's sake , and turned her eyes towards elinor to see how she bore these attacks , with an earnestness which gave elinor far more pain than could arise from such common - place raillery as mrs. jennings 's . </s>\", \"<s> colonel brandon , the friend of sir john , seemed no more adapted by resemblance of manner to be his friend , than lady middleton was to be his wife , or mrs. jennings to be lady middleton 's mother . </s>\", '<s> he was silent and grave . </s>', '<s> his appearance however was not unpleasing , in spite of his being in the opinion of marianne and margaret an absolute old bachelor , for he was on the wrong side of five and thirty ; but though his face was not handsome , his countenance was sensible , and his address was particularly gentlemanlike . </s>', '<s> there was nothing in any of the party which could recommend them as companions to the dashwoods ; but the cold insipidity of lady middleton was so particularly repulsive , that in comparison of it the gravity of colonel brandon , and even the boisterous mirth of sir john and his mother - in - law was interesting . </s>', '<s> lady middleton seemed to be roused to enjoyment only by the entrance of her four noisy children after dinner , who pulled her about , tore her clothes , and put an end to every kind of discourse except what related to themselves . </s>', '<s> in the evening , as marianne was discovered to be musical , she was invited to play . </s>', \"<s> the instrument was unlocked , every body prepared to be charmed , and marianne , who sang very well , at their request went through the chief of the songs which lady middleton had brought into the family on her marriage , and which perhaps had lain ever since in the same position on the pianoforte , for her ladyship had celebrated that event by giving up music , although by her mother 's account , she had played extremely well , and by her own was very fond of it . </s>\", \"<s> marianne 's performance was highly applauded . </s>\", '<s> sir john was loud in his admiration at the end of every song , and as loud in his conversation with the others while every song lasted . </s>', \"<s> lady middleton frequently called him to order , wondered how any one 's attention could be diverted from music for a moment , and asked marianne to sing a particular song which marianne had just finished . </s>\", '<s> colonel brandon alone , of all the party , heard her without being in raptures . </s>', '<s> he paid her only the compliment of attention ; and she felt a respect for him on the occasion , which the others had reasonably forfeited by their shameless want of taste . </s>', '<s> his pleasure in music , though it amounted not to that ecstatic delight which alone could sympathize with her own , was estimable when contrasted against the horrible insensibility of the others ; and she was reasonable enough to allow that a man of five and thirty might well have outlived all acuteness of feeling and every exquisite power of enjoyment . </s>', \"<s> she was perfectly disposed to make every allowance for the colonel 's advanced state of life which humanity required . </s>\", '<s> mrs. jennings was a widow with an ample jointure . </s>', '<s> she had only two daughters , both of whom she had lived to see respectably married , and she had now therefore nothing to do but to marry all the rest of the world . </s>', '<s> in the promotion of this object she was zealously active , as far as her ability reached ; and missed no opportunity of projecting weddings among all the young people of her acquaintance . </s>', '<s> she was remarkably quick in the discovery of attachments , and had enjoyed the advantage of raising the blushes and the vanity of many a young lady by insinuations of her power over such a young man ; and this kind of discernment enabled her soon after her arrival at barton decisively to pronounce that colonel brandon was very much in love with marianne dashwood . </s>', \"<s> she rather suspected it to be so , on the very first evening of their being together , from his listening so attentively while she sang to them ; and when the visit was returned by the middletons ' dining at the cottage , the fact was ascertained by his listening to her again . </s>\", '<s> it must be so . </s>', '<s> she was perfectly convinced of it . </s>', '<s> it would be an excellent match , for _ he _ was rich , and _ she _ was handsome . </s>', '<s> mrs. jennings had been anxious to see colonel brandon well married , ever since her connection with sir john first brought him to her knowledge ; and she was always anxious to get a good husband for every pretty girl . </s>', '<s> the immediate advantage to herself was by no means inconsiderable , for it supplied her with endless jokes against them both . </s>', '<s> at the park she laughed at the colonel , and in the cottage at marianne . </s>', \"<s> to the former her raillery was probably , as far as it regarded only himself , perfectly indifferent ; but to the latter it was at first incomprehensible ; and when its object was understood , she hardly knew whether most to laugh at its absurdity , or censure its impertinence , for she considered it as an unfeeling reflection on the colonel 's advanced years , and on his forlorn condition as an old bachelor . </s>\", '<s> mrs. dashwood , who could not think a man five years younger than herself , so exceedingly ancient as he appeared to the youthful fancy of her daughter , ventured to clear mrs. jennings from the probability of wishing to throw ridicule on his age . </s>', '<s> \" but at least , mamma , you can not deny the absurdity of the accusation , though you may not think it intentionally ill - natured . </s>', '<s> colonel brandon is certainly younger than mrs. jennings , but he is old enough to be _ my _ father ; and if he were ever animated enough to be in love , must have long outlived every sensation of the kind . </s>', '<s> it is too ridiculous ! </s>', '<s> when is a man to be safe from such wit , if age and infirmity will not protect him ? \" </s>', '<s> \" infirmity ! \" said elinor , \" do you call colonel brandon infirm ? </s>', '<s> i can easily suppose that his age may appear much greater to you than to my mother ; but you can hardly deceive yourself as to his having the use of his limbs ! \" </s>', '<s> \" did not you hear him complain of the rheumatism ? and is not that the commonest infirmity of declining life ? \" </s>', '<s> \" my dearest child , \" said her mother , laughing , \" at this rate you must be in continual terror of _ my _ decay ;

\" and with me a flannel waistcoat is invariably connected with aches , cramps , rheumatisms , and every species of ailment that can afflict the old and the feeble . \" </s>', '<s> \" had he been only in a violent fever , you would not have despised him half so much . </s>', '<s> confess , marianne , is not there something interesting to you in the flushed cheek , hollow eye , and quick pulse of a fever ? \" </s>', '<s> soon after this , upon elinor \\'s leaving the room , \" mamma , \" said marianne , \" i have an alarm on the subject of illness which i can not conceal from you . </s>', '<s> i am sure edward ferrars is not well . </s>', '<s> we have now been here almost a fortnight , and yet he does not come . </s>', '<s> nothing but real indisposition could occasion this extraordinary delay . </s>', '<s> what else can detain him at norland ? \" </s>', '<s> \" had you any idea of his coming so soon ? \" said mrs. dashwood . </s>', '<s> \" i had none . </s>', '<s> on the contrary , if i have felt any anxiety at all on the subject , it has been in recollecting that he sometimes showed a want of pleasure and readiness in accepting my invitation , when i talked of his coming to barton . </s>', '<s> does elinor expect him already ? \" </s>', '<s> i have never mentioned it to her , but of course she must . \" </s>', '<s> \" i rather think you are mistaken , for when i was talking to her yesterday of getting a new grate for the spare bed - chamber , she observed that there was no immediate hurry for it , as it was not likely that the room would be wanted for some time . \" </s>', '<s> \" how strange this is ! </s>', '<s> what can be the meaning of it ! </s>', '<s> but the whole of their behaviour to each other has been unaccountable ! </s>', '<s> how cold , how composed were their last adieus ! </s>', '<s> how languid their conversation the last evening of their being together ! </s>', \"<s> in edward 's farewell there was no distinction between elinor and me : it was the good wishes of an affectionate brother to both . </s>\", '<s> twice did i leave them purposely together in the course of the last morning , and each time did he most unaccountably follow me out of the room . </s>', '<s> and elinor , in quitting norland and edward , cried not as i did . </s>', '<s> even now her self - command is invariable . </s>', '<s> when is she dejected or melancholy ? </s>', '<s> when does she try to avoid society , or appear restless and dissatisfied in it ? \" </s>', '<s> the dashwoods were now settled at barton with tolerable comfort to themselves . </s>', '<s> the house and the garden , with all the objects surrounding them , were now become familiar , and the ordinary pursuits which had given to norland half its charms were engaged in again with far greater enjoyment than norland had been able to afford , since the loss of their father . </s>', '<s> sir john middleton , who called on them every day for the first fortnight , and who was not in the habit of seeing much occupation at home , could not conceal his amazement on finding them always employed . </s>', \"<s> their visitors , except those from barton park , were not many ; for , in spite of sir john 's urgent entreaties that they would mix more in the neighbourhood , and repeated assurances of his carriage being always at their service , the independence of mrs. dashwood 's spirit overcame the wish of society for her children ; and she was resolute in declining to visit any family beyond the distance of a walk . </s>\", '<s> there were but few who could be so classed ; and it was not all of them that were attainable . </s>', '<s> about a mile and a half from the cottage , along the narrow winding valley of allenham , which issued from that of barton , as formerly described , the girls had , in one of their earliest walks , discovered an ancient respectable looking mansion which , by reminding them a little of norland , interested their imagination and made them wish to be better acquainted with it . </s>', '<s> but they learnt , on enquiry , that its possessor , an elderly lady of very good character , was unfortunately too infirm to mix with the world , and never stirred from home . </s>', '<s> the whole country about them abounded in beautiful walks . </s>', '<s> the high downs which invited them from almost every window of the cottage to seek the exquisite enjoyment of air on their summits , were a happy alternative when the dirt of the valleys beneath shut up their superior beauties ; and towards one of these hills did marianne and margaret one memorable morning direct their steps , attracted by the partial sunshine of a showery sky , and unable longer to bear the confinement which the settled rain of the two preceding days had occasioned . </s>', \"<s> the weather was not tempting enough to draw the two others from their pencil and their book , in spite of marianne 's declaration that the day would be lastingly fair , and that every threatening cloud would be drawn off from their hills ; and the two girls set off together . </s>\", '<s> they gaily ascended the downs , rejoicing in their own penetration at every glimpse of blue sky ; and when they caught in their faces the animating gales of a high south - westerly wind , they pitied the fears which had prevented their mother and elinor from sharing such delightful sensations . </s>', '<s> \" is there a felicity in the world , \" said marianne , \" superior to this?--margaret , we will walk here at least two hours . \" </s>', '<s> margaret agreed , and they pursued their way against the wind , resisting it with laughing delight for about twenty minutes longer , when suddenly the clouds united over their heads , and a driving rain set full in their face . </s>', '<s> chagrined and surprised , they were obliged , though unwillingly , to turn back , for no shelter was nearer than their own house . </s>', '<s> one consolation however remained for them , to which the exigence of the moment gave more than usual propriety,--it was that of running with all possible speed down the steep side of the hill which led immediately to their garden gate . </s>', '<s> they set off . </s>', '<s> marianne had at first the advantage , but a false step brought her suddenly to the ground ; and margaret , unable to stop herself to assist her , was involuntarily hurried along , and reached the bottom in safety . </s>', '<s> a gentleman carrying a gun , with two pointers playing round him , was passing up the hill and within a few yards of marianne , when her accident happened . </s>', '<s> he put down his gun and ran to her assistance . </s>', '<s> she had raised herself from the ground , but her foot had been twisted in her fall , and she was scarcely able to stand . </s>', '<s> the gentleman offered his services ; and perceiving that her modesty declined what her situation rendered necessary , took her up in his arms without farther delay , and carried her down the hill . </s>', '<s> then passing through the garden , the gate of which had been left open by margaret , he bore her directly into the house , whither margaret was just arrived , and quitted not his hold till he had seated her in a chair in the parlour . </s>', '<s> elinor and her mother rose up in amazement at their entrance , and while the eyes of both were fixed on him with an evident wonder and a secret admiration which equally sprung from his appearance , he apologized for his intrusion by relating its cause , in a manner so frank and so graceful that his person , which was uncommonly handsome , received additional charms from his voice and expression . </s>', '<s> had he been even old , ugly , and vulgar , the gratitude and kindness of mrs. dashwood would have been secured by any act of attention to her child ; but the influence of youth , beauty , and elegance , gave an interest to the action which came home to her feelings . </s>', '<s> she thanked him again and again ; and , with a sweetness of address which always attended her , invited him to be seated . </s>', '<s> this he declined , as he was dirty and wet . </s>', '<s> mrs. dashwood then begged to know to whom she was obliged . </s>', '<s> his name , he replied , was willoughby , and his present home was at allenham , from whence he hoped she would allow him the honour of calling tomorrow to enquire after miss dashwood . </s>', '<s> the honour was readily granted , and he then departed , to make himself still more interesting , in the midst of a heavy rain . </s>', '<s> his manly beauty and more than common gracefulness were instantly the theme of general admiration , and the laugh which his gallantry raised against marianne received particular spirit from his exterior attractions . </s>', '<s> marianne herself had seen less of his person than the rest , for the confusion which crimsoned over her face , on his lifting her up , had robbed her of the power of regarding him after their entering the house . </s>', '<s> but she had seen enough of him to join in all the admiration of the others , and with an energy which always adorned her praise . </s>', '<s> his person and air were equal to what her fancy had ever drawn for the hero of a favourite story ; and in his carrying her into the house with so little previous formality , there was a rapidity of thought which particularly recommended the action to her . </s>', '<s> every circumstance belonging to him was interesting . </s>', '<s> his name was good , his residence was in their favourite village , and she soon found out that of all manly dresses a shooting - jacket was the most becoming . </s>', '<s> her imagination was busy , her reflections were pleasant , and the pain of a sprained ankle was disregarded . </s>', \"<s> sir john called on them as soon as the next interval of fair weather that morning allowed him to get out of doors ;

adding , \" yes , yes , he is very well worth catching i can tell you , miss dashwood ; he has a pretty little estate of his own in somersetshire besides ; and if i were you , i would not give him up to my younger sister , in spite of all this tumbling down hills . </s>', '<s> miss marianne must not expect to have all the men to herself . </s>', '<s> brandon will be jealous , if she does not take care . \" </s>', '<s> \" i do not believe , \" said mrs. dashwood , with a good humoured smile , \" that mr. willoughby will be incommoded by the attempts of either of _ my _ daughters towards what you call _ catching him . </s>', '<s> _ it is not an employment to which they have been brought up . </s>', '<s> men are very safe with us , let them be ever so rich . </s>', '<s> i am glad to find , however , from what you say , that he is a respectable young man , and one whose acquaintance will not be ineligible . \" </s>', '<s> \" he is as good a sort of fellow , i believe , as ever lived , \" repeated sir john . </s>', '<s> \" i remember last christmas at a little hop at the park , he danced from eight o\\'clock till four , without once sitting down . \" </s>', '<s> \" did he indeed ? \" cried marianne with sparkling eyes , \" and with elegance , with spirit ? \" </s>', '<s> yes ;

and his behaviour declared his wishes to be in that respect as earnest , as his abilities were strong . </s>', '<s> [ illustration : _ they sang together . _ ] </s>', '<s> her mother too , in whose mind not one speculative thought of their marriage had been raised , by his prospect of riches , was led before the end of a week to hope and expect it ;

and that however a general resemblance of disposition between the parties might forward the affection of mr. willoughby , an equally striking opposition of character was no hindrance to the regard of colonel brandon . </s>', '<s> she saw it with concern ; for what could a silent man of five and thirty hope , when opposed to a very lively one of five and twenty ? </s>', '<s> and as she could not even wish him successful , she heartily wished him indifferent . </s>', '<s> she liked him -- in spite of his gravity and reserve , she beheld in him an object of interest . </s>', '<s> his manners , though serious , were mild ; and his reserve appeared rather the result of some oppression of spirits than of any natural gloominess of temper . </s>', '<s> sir john had dropped hints of past injuries and disappointments , which justified her belief of his being an unfortunate man , and she regarded him with respect and compassion . </s>', '<s> perhaps she pitied and esteemed him the more because he was slighted by willoughby and marianne , who , prejudiced against him for being neither lively nor young , seemed resolved to undervalue his merits . </s>', '<s> \" brandon is just the kind of man , \" said willoughby one day , when they were talking of him together , \" whom every body speaks well of , and nobody cares about ;

and parties on the water were made and accomplished as often as a showery october would allow . </s>', '<s> in every meeting of the kind willoughby was included ; and the ease and familiarity which naturally attended these parties were exactly calculated to give increasing intimacy to his acquaintance with the dashwoods , to afford him opportunity of witnessing the excellencies of marianne , of marking his animated admiration of her , and of receiving , in her behaviour to himself , the most pointed assurance of her affection . </s>', '<s> elinor could not be surprised at their attachment . </s>', '<s> she only wished that it were less openly shown ; and once or twice did venture to suggest the propriety of some self - command to marianne . </s>', '<s> but marianne abhorred all concealment where no real disgrace could attend unreserve ; and to aim at the restraint of sentiments which were not in themselves illaudable , appeared to her not merely an unnecessary effort , but a disgraceful subjection of reason to common - place and mistaken notions . </s>', '<s> willoughby thought the same ; and their behaviour at all times , was an illustration of their opinions . </s>', '<s> when he was present she had no eyes for any one else . </s>', '<s> every thing he did , was right . </s>', '<s> every thing he said , was clever . </s>', '<s> if their evenings at the park were concluded with cards , he cheated himself and all the rest of the party to get her a good hand . </s>', '<s> if dancing formed the amusement of the night , they were partners for half the time ; and when obliged to separate for a couple of dances , were careful to stand together and scarcely spoke a word to any body else . </s>', '<s> such conduct made them of course most exceedingly laughed at ; but ridicule could not shame , and seemed hardly to provoke them . </s>', '<s> mrs. dashwood entered into all their feelings with a warmth which left her no inclination for checking this excessive display of them . </s>', '<s> to her it was but the natural consequence of a strong affection in a young and ardent mind . </s>', '<s> this was the season of happiness to marianne . </s>', '<s> her heart was devoted to willoughby , and the fond attachment to norland , which she brought with her from sussex , was more likely to be softened than she had thought it possible before , by the charms which his society bestowed on her present home . </s>', \"<s> elinor 's happiness was not so great . </s>\", '<s> her heart was not so much at ease , nor her satisfaction in their amusements so pure . </s>', '<s> they afforded her no companion that could make amends for what she had left behind , nor that could teach her to think of norland with less regret than ever . </s>', '<s> neither lady middleton nor mrs. jennings could supply to her the conversation she missed ; although the latter was an everlasting talker , and from the first had regarded her with a kindness which ensured her a large share of her discourse . </s>', \"<s> she had already repeated her own history to elinor three or four times ; and had elinor 's memory been equal to her means of improvement , she might have known very early in their acquaintance all the particulars of mr. jennings 's last illness , and what he said to his wife a few minutes before he died . </s>\", '<s> lady middleton was more agreeable than her mother only in being more silent . </s>', '<s> elinor needed little observation to perceive that her reserve was a mere calmness of manner with which sense had nothing to do . </s>', '<s> towards her husband and mother she was the same as to them ; and intimacy was therefore neither to be looked for nor desired . </s>', '<s> she had nothing to say one day that she had not said the day before . </s>', '<s> her insipidity was invariable , for even her spirits were always the same ; and though she did not oppose the parties arranged by her husband , provided every thing were conducted in style and her two eldest children attended her , she never appeared to receive more enjoyment from them than she might have experienced in sitting at home ; and so little did her presence add to the pleasure of the others , by any share in their conversation , that they were sometimes only reminded of her being amongst them by her solicitude about her troublesome boys . </s>', '<s> in colonel brandon alone , of all her new acquaintance , did elinor find a person who could in any degree claim the respect of abilities , excite the interest of friendship , or give pleasure as a companion . </s>', '<s> willoughby was out of the question . </s>', \"<s> her admiration and regard , even her sisterly regard , was all his own ; but he was a lover ; his attentions were wholly marianne 's , and a far less agreeable man might have been more generally pleasing . </s>\", '<s> colonel brandon , unfortunately for himself , had no such encouragement to think only of marianne , and in conversing with elinor he found the greatest consolation for the indifference of her sister . </s>', \"<s> elinor 's compassion for him increased , as she had reason to suspect that the misery of disappointed love had already been known to him . </s>\", '<s> this suspicion was given by some words which accidentally dropped from him one evening at the park , when they were sitting down together by mutual consent , while the others were dancing . </s>', '<s> his eyes were fixed on marianne , and , </s>', '<s> after a silence of some minutes , he said , with a faint smile , \" your sister , i understand , does not approve of second attachments . \" </s>', '<s> \" no , \" replied elinor , \" her opinions are all romantic . \" </s>', '<s> \" or rather , as i believe , she considers them impossible to exist . \" </s>', '<s> \" i believe she does . </s>', '<s> but how she contrives it without reflecting on the character of her own father , who had himself two wives , i know not . </s>', '<s> a few years however will settle her opinions on the reasonable basis of common sense and observation ; and then they may be more easy to define and to justify than they now are , by any body but herself . \" </s>', '<s> \" this will probably be the case , \" he replied ; \" and yet there is something so amiable in the prejudices of a young mind , that one is sorry to see them give way to the reception of more general opinions . \" </s>', '<s> \" i can not agree with you there , \" said elinor . </s>', '<s> \" there are inconveniences attending such feelings as marianne \\'s , which all the charms of enthusiasm and ignorance of the world can not atone for . </s>', '<s> her systems have all the unfortunate tendency of setting propriety at nought ; and a better acquaintance with the world is what i look forward to as her greatest possible advantage . \" </s>', '<s> after a short pause he resumed the conversation by saying-- </s>', '<s> \" does your sister make no distinction in her objections against a second attachment ? or is it equally criminal in every body ? </s>', '<s> are those who have been disappointed in their first choice , whether from the inconstancy of its object , or the perverseness of circumstances , to be equally indifferent during the rest of their lives ? \" </s>', '<s> \" upon my word , i am not acquainted with the minutiae of her principles . </s>', '<s> i only know that i never yet heard her admit any instance of a second attachment \\'s being pardonable . \" </s>', '<s> \" this , \" said he , \" can not hold ; but a change , a total change of sentiments -- no , no , do not desire it ; for when the romantic refinements of a young mind are obliged to give way , how frequently are they succeeded by such opinions as are but too common , and too dangerous ! </s>', '<s> i speak from experience . </s>', '<s> i once knew a lady who in temper and mind greatly resembled your sister , who thought and judged like her , but who from an enforced change -- from a series of unfortunate circumstances-- \" here he stopped suddenly ; appeared to think that he had said too much , and by his countenance gave rise to conjectures , which might not otherwise have entered elinor \\'s head . </s>', '<s> the lady would probably have passed without suspicion , had he not convinced miss dashwood that what concerned her ought not to escape his lips . </s>', '<s> as it was , it required but a slight effort of fancy to connect his emotion with the tender recollection of past regard . </s>', '<s> elinor attempted no more . </s>', '<s> but marianne , in her place , would not have done so little . </s>', '<s> the whole story would have been speedily formed under her active imagination ; and every thing established in the most melancholy order of disastrous love . </s>', \"<s> as elinor and marianne were walking together the next morning the latter communicated a piece of news to her sister , which in spite of all that she knew before of marianne 's imprudence and want of thought , surprised her by its extravagant testimony of both . </s>\", '<s> marianne told her , with the greatest delight , that willoughby had given her a horse , one that he had bred himself on his estate in somersetshire , and which was exactly calculated to carry a woman . </s>', \"<s> without considering that it was not in her mother 's plan to keep any horse , that if she were to alter her resolution in favour of this gift , she must buy another for the servant , and keep a servant to ride it , and after all , build a stable to receive them , she had accepted the present without hesitation , and told her sister of it in raptures . </s>\", '<s> \" he intends to send his groom into somersetshire immediately for it , \" she added , \" and when it arrives we will ride every day . </s>', '<s> you shall share its use with me . </s>', '<s> imagine to yourself , my dear elinor , the delight of a gallop on some of these downs . \" </s>', '<s> most unwilling was she to awaken from such a dream of felicity to comprehend all the unhappy truths which attended the affair ; and for some time she refused to submit to them . </s>', '<s> as to an additional servant , the expense would be a trifle ; mamma she was sure would never object to it ; and any horse would do for _ him _ ; he might always get one at the park ; as to a stable , the merest shed would be sufficient . </s>', '<s> elinor then ventured to doubt the propriety of her receiving such a present from a man so little , or at least so lately known to her . </s>', '<s> this was too much . </s>', '<s> \" you are mistaken , elinor , \" said she warmly , \" in supposing i know very little of willoughby . </s>', '<s> i have not known him long indeed , but i am much better acquainted with him , than i am with any other creature in the world , except yourself and mama . </s>', '<s> it is not time or opportunity that is to determine intimacy ; it is disposition alone . </s>', '<s> seven years would be insufficient to make some people acquainted with each other , and seven days are more than enough for others . </s>', '<s> i should hold myself guilty of greater impropriety in accepting a horse from my brother , than from willoughby . </s>', '<s> of john i know very little , though we have lived together for years ; but of willoughby my judgment has long been formed . \" </s>', '<s> elinor thought it wisest to touch that point no more . </s>', \"<s> she knew her sister 's temper . </s>\", '<s> opposition on so tender a subject would only attach her the more to her own opinion . </s>', '<s> but by an appeal to her affection for her mother , by representing the inconveniences which that indulgent mother must draw on herself , if ( as would probably be the case ) she consented to this increase of establishment , marianne was shortly subdued ; and she promised not to tempt her mother to such imprudent kindness by mentioning the offer , and to tell willoughby when she saw him next , that it must be declined . </s>', '<s> she was faithful to her word ; and when willoughby called at the cottage , the same day , elinor heard her express her disappointment to him in a low voice , on being obliged to forego the acceptance of his present . </s>', '<s> the reasons for this alteration were at the same time related , and they were such as to make further entreaty on his side impossible . </s>', '<s> his concern however was very apparent ; and after expressing it with earnestness , he added , in the same low voice , \" </s>', '<s> but , marianne , the horse is still yours , though you can not use it now . </s>', '<s> i shall keep it only till you can claim it . </s>', '<s> when you leave barton to form your own establishment in a more lasting home , queen mab shall receive you . \" </s>', '<s> this was all overheard by miss dashwood ; and in the whole of the sentence , in his manner of pronouncing it , and in his addressing her sister by her christian name alone , she instantly saw an intimacy so decided , a meaning so direct , as marked a perfect agreement between them . </s>', '<s> from that moment she doubted not of their being engaged to each other ; and the belief of it created no other surprise than that she , or any of their friends , should be left by tempers so frank , to discover it by accident . </s>', '<s> margaret related something to her the next day , which placed this matter in a still clearer light . </s>', '<s> willoughby had spent the preceding evening with them , and margaret , by being left some time in the parlour with only him and marianne , had had opportunity for observations , which , with a most important face , she communicated to her eldest sister , when they were next by themselves . </s>', '<s> \" oh , elinor ! \" she cried , \" i have such a secret to tell you about marianne . </s>', '<s> i am sure she will be married to mr. willoughby very soon . \" </s>', '<s> \" you have said so </s>', '<s> , \" replied elinor , \" almost every day since they first met on high - church down ;

but i am the more concerned , as i fear my presence is necessary to gain your admittance at whitwell . \" </s>', '<s> what a blow upon them all was this ! </s>', '<s> \" but if you write a note to the housekeeper , mr. brandon , \" said marianne , eagerly , \" will it not be sufficient ? \" </s>', '<s> he shook his head . </s>', '<s> \" we must go , \" said sir john . </s>', '<s> \" it shall not be put off when we are so near it . </s>', '<s> you can not go to town till tomorrow , brandon , that is all . \" </s>', '<s> \" i wish it could be so easily settled . </s>', '<s> but it is not in my power to delay my journey for one day ! \" </s>', '<s> \" if you would but let us know what your business is , \" said mrs. jennings , \" we might see whether it could be put off or not . \" </s>', '<s> \" you would not be six hours later , \" said willoughby , \" if you were to defer your journey till our return . \" </s>', '<s> i can not afford to lose _ one _ hour . \" </s>', '<s> elinor then heard willoughby say , in a low voice to marianne , \" there are some people who can not bear a party of pleasure . </s>', '<s> brandon is one of them . </s>', '<s> he was afraid of catching cold i dare say , and invented this trick for getting out of it . </s>', '<s> i would lay fifty guineas the letter was of his own writing . \" </s>', '<s> \" i have no doubt of it , \" replied marianne . </s>', '<s> \" there is no persuading you to change your mind , brandon , i know of old , \" said sir john , \" when once you are determined on anything . </s>', '<s> but , however , i hope you will think better of it . </s>', '<s> consider , here are the two miss careys come over from newton , the three miss dashwoods walked up from the cottage , and mr. willoughby got up two hours before his usual time , on purpose to go to whitwell . \" </s>', '<s> colonel brandon again repeated his sorrow at being the cause of disappointing the party ; but at the same time declared it to be unavoidable . </s>', '<s> well , then , when will you come back again ? \" </s>', '<s> \" i hope we shall see you at barton , \" added her ladyship , \" as soon as you can conveniently leave town ;

and they all agreed again and again how provoking it was to be so disappointed . </s>', '<s> \" i can guess what his business is , however , \" said mrs. jennings exultingly . </s>', '<s> \" can you , ma\\'am ? \" said almost every body . </s>', '<s> \" yes ; it is about miss williams , i am sure . \" </s>', '<s> \" and who is miss williams ? \" asked marianne . </s>', '<s> \" what ! do not you know who miss williams is ? </s>', '<s> i am sure you must have heard of her before . </s>', \"<s> she is a relation of the colonel 's , my dear ; a very near relation . </s>\", '<s> we will not say how near , for fear of shocking the young ladies . \" </s>', '<s> then , lowering her voice a little , she said to elinor , \" she is his natural daughter . \" </s>', '<s> \" indeed ! \" </s>', '<s> \" oh , yes ; and as like him as she can stare . </s>', '<s> i dare say the colonel will leave her all his fortune . \" </s>', '<s> when sir john returned , he joined most heartily in the general regret on so unfortunate an event ; concluding however by observing , that as they were all got together , they must do something by way of being happy ; and after some consultation it was agreed , that although happiness could only be enjoyed at whitwell , they might procure a tolerable composure of mind by driving about the country . </s>', \"<s> the carriages were then ordered ; willoughby 's was first , and marianne never looked happier than when she got into it . </s>\", '<s> he drove through the park very fast , and they were soon out of sight ; and nothing more of them was seen till their return , which did not happen till after the return of all the rest . </s>', '<s> they both seemed delighted with their drive ; but said only in general terms that they had kept in the lanes , while the others went on the downs . </s>', '<s> it was settled that there should be a dance in the evening , and that every body should be extremely merry all day long . </s>', '<s> some more of the careys came to dinner , and they had the pleasure of sitting down nearly twenty to table , which sir john observed with great contentment . </s>', '<s> willoughby took his usual place between the two elder miss dashwoods . </s>', '<s> mrs. jennings sat on elinor \\'s right hand ; and they had not been long seated , before she leant behind her and willoughby , and said to marianne , loud enough for them both to hear , \" i have found you out in spite of all your tricks . </s>', '<s> i know where you spent the morning . \" </s>', '<s> marianne coloured , and replied very hastily , \" where , pray ? \" </s>', '<s> \" did not you know , \" said willoughby , \" that we had been out in my curricle ? \" </s>', '<s> \" yes , yes , mr. impudence , i know that very well , and i was determined to find out _ where _ you had been to . </s>', '<s> i hope you like your house , miss marianne . </s>', '<s> it is a very large one , i know ; and when i come to see you , i hope you will have new - furnished it , for it wanted it very much when i was there six years ago . \" </s>', '<s> marianne turned away in great confusion . </s>', \"<s> mrs. jennings laughed heartily ; and elinor found that in her resolution to know where they had been , she had actually made her own woman enquire of mr. willoughby 's groom ; and that she had by that method been informed that they had gone to allenham , and spent a considerable time there in walking about the garden and going all over the house . </s>\", '<s> elinor could hardly believe this to be true , as it seemed very unlikely that willoughby should propose , or marianne consent , to enter the house while mrs. smith was in it , with whom marianne had not the smallest acquaintance . </s>', '<s> as soon as they left the dining - room , elinor enquired of her about it ; and great was her surprise when she found that every circumstance related by mrs. jennings was perfectly true . </s>', '<s> marianne was quite angry with her for doubting it . </s>', '<s> \" why should you imagine , elinor , that we did not go there , or that we did not see the house ? </s>', '<s> is not it what you have often wished to do yourself ? \" </s>', '<s> yes , marianne , but i would not go while mrs. smith was there , and with no other companion than mr. willoughby . \" </s>', '<s> [ illustration : \" _ i have found you out in spite of all your tricks . _ \" ] </s>', '<s> \" mr. willoughby however is the only person who can have a right to show that house ; and as he went in an open carriage , it was impossible to have any other companion . </s>', '<s> i never spent a pleasanter morning in my life . \" </s>', '<s> \" i am afraid , \" replied elinor , \" that the pleasantness of an employment does not always evince its propriety . \" </s>', '<s> \" on the contrary , nothing can be a stronger proof of it , elinor ; for if there had been any real impropriety in what i did , i should have been sensible of it at the time , for we always know when we are acting wrong , and with such a conviction i could have had no pleasure . \" </s>', '<s> \" but , my dear marianne , as it has already exposed you to some very impertinent remarks , do you not now begin to doubt the discretion of your own conduct ? \" </s>', '<s> \" if the impertinent remarks of mrs. jennings are to be the proof of impropriety in conduct , we are all offending every moment of our lives . </s>', '<s> i value not her censure any more than i should do her commendation . </s>', \"<s> i am not sensible of having done anything wrong in walking over mrs. smith 's grounds , or in seeing her house . </s>\", '<s> they will one day be mr. willoughby \\'s , and-- \" </s>', '<s> if they were one day to be your own , marianne , you would not be justified in what you have done . \" </s>', '<s> she blushed at this hint ; but it was even visibly gratifying to her ; and after a ten minutes \\' interval of earnest thought , she came to her sister again , and said with great good humour , \" perhaps , elinor , it _ was _ rather ill - judged in me to go to allenham ; but mr. willoughby wanted particularly to show me the place ; and it is a charming house , i assure you . </s>', '<s> there is one remarkably pretty sitting room up stairs ; of a nice comfortable size for constant use , and with modern furniture it would be delightful . </s>', '<s> it is a corner room , and has windows on two sides . </s>', '<s> on one side you look across the bowling - green , behind the house , to a beautiful hanging wood , and on the other you have a view of the church and village , and , beyond them , of those fine bold hills that we have so often admired . </s>', '<s> i did not see it to advantage , for nothing could be more forlorn than the furniture ; but if it were newly fitted up -- a couple of hundred pounds , willoughby says , would make it one of the pleasantest summer - rooms in england . \" </s>', '<s> could elinor have listened to her without interruption from the others , she would have described every room in the house with equal delight . </s>']\n"
